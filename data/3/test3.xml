    <text>the build quality of the two new apple iphones is lower than previous models, according to insurance company squaretrade.  squaretrade offers a gadget protection plan so it is jolly interested to know which phones it will have to pay out more to replace. americans have spent over $6 billion on broken iphones.  according to phys.org, while smartphones have tended to improve in durability, the iphone 5c and 5s are a step backwards and both received worse grades than the iphone 5.  squaretrade has put top-selling smartphones through a series of tests like dropping from five feet and submerging in water for 10 seconds.  eight different factors are used to calculate the phone's durability like materials used for the front and back, weight and size.  the phones are scored from one to ten, with a higher score meaning the phone is more likely to break.  last year, the iphone 5 had a score of five, but this year, the iphone 5s received a score of 5.5 and the iphone 5c received a score of 6.  the worst phone for durability was the samsung galaxy s4, which got a score of 7, while the best scoring phone was the google moto x with a score of 4.5.  ty shay, chief marketing officer at squaretrade had expected that at least one of the new iphone models would up its game, but it was the moto x that proved most forgiving of accidents.  it had been expected that the 5c would be less durable than the 5s because of its plastic case, but if you want an iphone to last it is probably better that you hang onto the iphone 5.</text>

    <text>i have upgraded my iphone 5 to ios7. ios7 screen has become very bright. we can't see clearly in lighting. for younger guys it may be ok but for elders it has become very very hard to read texts etc. not so good as ios6. ios6 look is very elegant n very much professional. ios7 is not as good as we thought it would be. very much disappointing in some ways. keyboard is not good like in ios6. the fonts became very thin n can't be seen clearly when typing texts. the new icons don't impress much as they are flat unlike in ios6. battery drains out very fast after upgrade. contact assigned photo gets blurred when we make a call. only incoming calls photo can be seen. this is ridiculous n i am not happy about that. i want to go back to ios6, i don't like the ios7. apple must to allow customers to downgrade to ios6 from ios7. because customers paid a lot of money so they have the right to opt whatever they like on their devices but should not be forced to use whatever the apple released. customers choice must be the final but not apple's choice. in such case apple customers will gradually opt for other platforms like android or windows or whatever they think they have more options .so apple should think of it and let the customers enjoy their choice, but not the mercy of apple. change should not be only for the sake of change it should satisfy the choice of customers, and it should make not only apple fanboys but also others attract and  stay with apple. so please rethink of allowing to downgrade to ios6 from ios7 in order to satisfy its customers before they start replacing their mobiles with androids. or at least change the things what they want to bring the looks of ios6 with keyboard, fonts thickness, etc etc.. for me i don't like ios7 as much as i had liked ios6. i wish i could downgrade to ios6 immediately if apple allows. if not, i will think of getting rid off my apple products n will go for others which saves money. please rethink.</text>

    <text>was torn between jumping from android to iphone as i do love my sony's but having played with my wife's 4s with the new updated 7.0 i was won over. i went for the iphone 5 as the 5s was just too much money and the 5c felt cheap and after comparing the 5 to the 5c it was a no brainer the 5c just isnt worth anything considering its newer than the 5. after a few weeks of playing with my 5 i must say im impressed with its user friendlyness even more so than the old android jellybean its just plain nicer to look at lol i have filled it up with all my old music (after putting it on itunes) the camera is far better than my old sony xperia s in terms of quality which i foun strange considering the sony was 12mp and the 5 is only 8mp, and i find i have better signals from my provider which is still o2. over all i would say to anyone looking at iphones if you cant afford the 5s then do yourself a favour and get the iphone 5 not the 5c its the same phone only better built :)</text>
