    <text>hi, people out there. This is one of the best fone that I have used. To say, I am a real fan of good fones. the rest of the fones use quad core processor and stuff, but all that wont beat apple and its performance. This could be said as one of the best of its kind.</text>

    <text>I have upgraded my iPhone 5 to ios7. Ios7 screen has become very bright. We can't see clearly in lighting. For younger guys it may be ok but for elders it has become very very hard to read texts etc. not so good as ios6. Ios6 look is very elegant n very much professional. Ios7 is not as good as we thought it would be. Very much disappointing in some ways. Keyboard is not good like in ios6. The fonts became very thin n can't be seen clearly when typing texts. The new icons don't impress much as they are flat unlike in ios6. Battery drains out very fast after upgrade. Contact assigned photo gets blurred when we make a call. Only incoming calls photo can be seen. This is ridiculous n I am not happy about that. I want to go back to ios6, I don't like the ios7. Apple must to allow customers to downgrade to ios6 from ios7. Because customers paid a lot of money so they have the right to opt whatever they like on their devices but should not be forced to use whatever the apple released. Customers choice must be the final but not apple's choice. In such case Apple customers will gradually opt for other platforms like Android or Windows or whatever they think they have more options .So Apple should think of it and let the customers enjoy their choice, but not the mercy of Apple. Change should not be only for the sake of change it should satisfy the choice of customers, and it should make not only Apple fanboys but also others attract and stay with Apple. So please rethink of allowing to downgrade to ios6 from ios7 in order to satisfy its customers before they start replacing their mobiles with Androids. Or at least change the things what they want to bring the looks of ios6 with keyboard, fonts thickness, etc etc..  This is My opinion also and I agree with comment posted above by a user. I would also like to have my old look back other wise I have to sell this one and go for Samsung. Just bought this in January so I feel bad. Plz let me know if I can get my old look back. I will also advice my friends to check before buying.</text>

I wish I could downgrade to ios6 immediately if apple allows. If not, I will think of getting rid off my apple products n will go for others which saves money. Please rethink.</text>

    <text>i too have a iphone 4s and have been using it for more than a year. but since i upgraded to ios7 i am facing lots of problem (battery, auto mute while talking, worst appearance etc.,).  1. The developers should re think on bringing the older look which is very professional including the search option. 2. Fix the battery, keypad bug.  as soon as possible.</text>

    <text>does anyone have this problem with an iphone 5? you are in the middle of a call and all of the sudden, the call fails, then the 'end call' hangs for a good two minutes before you can actually make another call.  02 blamed IPhone and Apple blamed 02. Three sim cards and two phones later, there is no difference.</text>

    <text>I have been using Iphone for the first time in my life for nearly a year now, used LTC before for a few years, it was boring, keep on hang. Honestly my Iphone 5 does not hang at all, that is suprisingly amazing to me, functions really well. I bought the black color one but no major scratch (yet, I am a careful user). The speed is superbly smooth going like a silk and i need to mention this again, it does not hang! i am really happy with that. I advise if u never use an Iphone before and have been using other products, I can tell you that its well worth it, n I am a very satisfied customer. Btw, it look stunning. enhances my good looks. haha</text>

    <text>iphone 5 has 2 disadvantages in my opinion: a)Screen size, but you know that before you bought it. It has excellent performance on browsing but you cant enjoy at all because of the screen size. b)if you buy the black one as i do, use a case or every minute you will find new scratches on your phone coating. After some days of headache because of scratches i bought that flip case and now i am ok!  Main advantages: quality, performance, ios 7.</text>

    <text>My unit has a defective screen,dead pixels with black tiny stripes that took more than 70% of the screen, purchased it only last July 2013 :(. I have never dropped the phone or placed it in a wet surface. been using it under normal condition. Most of the time it stays in my bag since cellphones are not allowed inside my office. I thought this is the most durable phone today.</text>

    <text>hello, i have some question to ask regarding the LTE support on the iPhone5. i bought an iphone5 from apple store in paris, but im currently living in MALAYSIA, just a neighbouring country of singapore. the problem is that my LTE isn't functioning..So my question is that, is there a possibility that my LTE will not function because i bought it in paris and used it in MALAYSIA, or is it my device is spoilt?</text>

    <text>Iphone 5 is definitely an excellent phone, but the for ones whom like to 'personalize' and have fun with the system of their units it is certainly not preferable. So it's up to which side are you in. And despite the solid built, imho, it's too costly and lack of value.</text>

    <text>Most of Android phones which was released in 2011 have worn our too bad but iPhone 4s still looks new. In 2012 most of Android phones people are selling them because they feel its their phone is outdated and looks achromatic but iPhone 5 looks pretty new and lovely without pouch which I'm not using. I'll use iPhone till death</text>

    <text>I used to use a Nokia 6700 and 6720 and was very happy with that compared to the iPhone. Nokia should have focused on these phones and the pricing. Symbian was a good OS. MS is going to kill Nokia ! too bad. I still think my old nokia phones are much better than all this hype created by smart phones</text>

    <text>The build quality of the two new Apple iPhones is lower than previous models, according to insurance company SquareTrade.  SquareTrade offers a gadget protection plan so it is jolly interested to know which phones it will have to pay out more to replace. Americans have spent over $6 billion on broken iPhones.  According to Phys.org, while smartphones have tended to improve in durability, the iPhone 5C and 5S are a step backwards and both received worse grades than the iPhone 5.  SquareTrade has put top-selling smartphones through a series of tests like dropping from five feet and submerging in water for 10 seconds.  Eight different factors are used to calculate the phone's durability like materials used for the front and back, weight and size.  The phones are scored from one to ten, with a higher score meaning the phone is more likely to break.  Last year, the iPhone 5 had a score of five, but this year, the iPhone 5S received a score of 5.5 and the iPhone 5C received a score of 6.  The worst phone for durability was the Samsung Galaxy S4, which got a score of 7, while the best scoring phone was the Google Moto X with a score of 4.5.  Ty Shay, chief marketing officer at SquareTrade had expected that at least one of the new iPhone models would up its game, but it was the Moto X that proved most forgiving of accidents.  It had been expected that the 5C would be less durable than the 5S because of its plastic case, but if you want an iPhone to last it is probably better that you hang onto the iPhone 5.</text>

    <text>I bought an Iphone 5 last month I don't see anything impressive about the phone especially when you compare it with Samsung galaxy S4,really S4 is giving it a hiding.First it doesn't memory card slot,no removable battery,even to put the sim card in the phone its a mission because u'll need the special tool to do that.To me only the looks of it is the that is attractive.</text>

    <text>I cannot believe that Apple advertise the Iphone 5 with a 8MP camera it should be more like a 2MP camera. The quality is extremely poor and I am very dissipointed. When someone spend the amount of money what Apple users are currently spending then you would like to have a top class quality phone with amazing features. I am very dissipointed with Apple and i will prefer to rather go back to my Blackberry. The camera is only one feature that i am mentioning but there are a lot more that dissipointed me and if i can make my dicision all over again then i would and Apple will definitly not be on my shopping list.</text>

    <text>I have no allegiance to any vendor but here's some stuff for you:  At work and in personal life heres some recent Iphone 5 stats:  2 people at work (their personal phones) 5 swap outs between them - in the last 6 months:  1 person at work (work phone)about to have a swap out (5 days)  Family members new iphone about to be swapped out (6 days).  Devices are about choice and preference for some and fashion statements for others.  Once thing that is clearly obvious, those that made choice can't seem to handle the fact the object of their desire isn't as great as they hoped it would be.</text>

    <text>Hi Guys, I bought my I Phone 5 just 3 months ago, one day it has given me battery error (as it looks like almost finished and after an hour it shows me full) and from last few days I am getting problem with its mouse which start and stop working automatically without any intimation, I purchased this from DG Sharaf (Muscat) and the time when I have contacted them they didnt give me good response as they said that I have to leave my phone with them and they will take 10 to 15 days to check and resolve this issue. As per my opinion this Apple items are just costly but not durable and reliable. If anyone wants, I can show my invoice and I can provide my contact details for to give you justification on this product.</text>

    <text>I'm not saying maybe businessmen are using phablets I'm telling you for a fact that it is very increasingly happening, because I'm guessing you've barely ever touched an Android device because the fact is they can do 80% of what a laptop can do and businessmen who aren't stuck in an office all day are seeing the benefit of a phablet that is small enough to fit in your pocket but big enough to comfortably see the screen.</text>

    <text>Taking over? Haha. C'mon business men have laptops. You can see a few with tablets but. Mostly kids have tablets for gaming. Smoothness reliability durability and accuracy are just one of the few reasons why people still choose iphone. Can't argue with that.</text>

    <text>iphone has less features than android but enough. but some features of todays phones are required.it run better and faster than android in less ram and smaller processor. the problem is stupid restrictions like that prison itunes. irritates too much. and that theme on ios 7 is very ugly. i think 5s wont be good and not much new but make 6 innovative and give freedom. please dont follow &quot;make everything large&quot; like sheep. not large than 4.3&quot;. make iphablets for those who are asking for large screen</text>

    <text>If you need an android and an iOS device and you dont want to spend 1000 bucks i have an option for you! Get an iPod touch 5g 16GB and a nexus 4 16GB both of them combined cost less then an iPhone 5 but are much more useful!</text>

    <text>Apple is total crap. Even chinese xiaomi has a full hd phone or 1080pixels but iphone5 is only 640 pixels made by korean lg, china xiami sports quadcore cortex a15 but iphone only obsolete dual core cortex a5/6, xiaomi sports 2gb ram ddr3 but iphone only 512mb usable obsolete lpddr1 ram, xiaomi has 64 gb internal plus microsd card slot iphone has none, xiaomi is beautiful easy to use but iphone is not, xiaomi is premium chinese pride  but apple is built by foxconn china and the chinese from crap parts/materials. And xiaomi is china generic, but apple could not even come to one fourth its beauty poise quality. Well china build the apple so you would expecg the apple would be decades inferior to the china phone. Go china go japan go korea go india go vietnam, go go go.</text>

    <text>Hi I just bought an iPhone 5 so far I just love the phone. But I have one problem with it. Which is..when ever I click the home screen button to go back it takes time or never go back. And this morning when I read the instructions on a little booklet it came with. It says double click home screen in Oder to go back or switch between applications and tap on the app icon icon. What am I doing wrong?</text>

    <text>Actually phablets like the Note are very quickly taking over from iPhone because with iPhone you have to carry a phone and a tablet, But the last few years people in business are realising it's better to carry 1 device that can do everything they need.</text>

    <text>8 cores actually do make a difference because it uses 4 A15 cores for most things and an extra 4 A6 cores to save power because when you not using the phone it switches to the low-power cores or if you just doing something simple like listening to music it can help save the battery a lot. And you obviously have no idea how ram works if you think 3gb is too much because it means the Note 3 can handle things like 4K videos, do more things at once and the phone doesn't have to keep closing tasks so everything opens quicker.</text>

    <text>No matter what materials you use big phones are always easier to break than things like the little tiny iPhone, Because even phones a quarter of the price of iPhone with the same little 3.5&quot;-4&quot; screens are almost as strong and reliable, So all Apple does is give expensive materials because it makes people who don't know any better think that it makes a better phone when it's actually just for show to give people something to brag about.</text>

    <text>It's not better but there was an expectation.  This means, that people thought they wuold get better o/s, redesidned look and feel to the phone.  There was nothing really new introduced to the phone which is why the market does not think it's better, and that is why you see the lower rating.  Personally I use iphone and galaxy phones but on my personal phone I switched to galaxy when the s2 came out.  There was no comparing, iphone is miles behind.</text>

    <text>the way you put it in that context saying android is for geeks ect is false really, as nearly all apple products are more expensive, classed as a more luuxury phone really, also the iphone battery is absolutly apauling compared to some of the galaxys, especially the s4, one of my friends has an s4 and doesnt need to charge it for what like 2 days and uses it a lot, where as my iphone 5 needs charging withing like 14 hours or less!</text>

    <text>1. More Battery Efficient. 2. More Control over Application lifecycle. 3. One quick glance in one page, you can see all notifications/date/time/badges/status of network/bt/batterylife etc. 4. No rouge application, all are tested to work and will not run in infinite loop and drain battery. 5. iTunes/iCloud sync. Your iphone 3gs can live on with iphone 5. Everything including social / games / webbrowsing / etc can be transferred over and it works. (Compared to rooted android's titanium backup)  Put it simply, iOS is for people who want a working mobile and concentrate on real life, while android is for tweaks and geeks who have too much time on hand and spend it all on their mobile.</text>

    <text>According to Apple,  any display with high resolution means any display with more than 300 ppi is called Retina display. Based on this, Retina is just a trademark  taken by Apple. So Retina means nothing new it has, it is just a display having more than 300 ppi resolution fore mobile phone and more than 220 ppi for tablet.</text>

    <text>after about 2months of use of iphone 5 , i think i can now give my verdict. i have been a nokia user all my life until now, i changed to apple because i wanted a secure operating system not easily prone to crashes and viruses, most of the nokia phones i used have at one time crashed even the one i used before the iphone 5 , the nokia e6. the iphone 5 is a very beautiful phone and really safe and works perfectly well especially the auto-correct keyboard which makes it work so well instead of making a larger screen iphone for a larger keyboard, so i advise apple to keep the restrictions on it because thats the reason why someone like me changed over to apple. i cant but comment on some draw backs though, the messaging is not well compartmentallised to sent,inbox,draft,received messages, delivery report and an extra folder to keep important messages like in my nokia e6,then i had to buy an application in app store to be able to send a contact card to people and even with that , i'm still unable to receive any contact card sent to the phone. i hope ios 7 will correct these issues. overall its the best phone out there and apple should keep the 4inch screen, anything bigger is probably not good. keep also the closed/restricted operating system as this protects the phone.</text>

    <text>Its a good phone but now a days, iphone5 is no longer the best. It is now always left behind with new ideas. dual core while others are in quad.  If iphone 5s would be quad, other brand are in octa core. No new design since first gen. not even water, dust and shock proof like experia  No super zoom for cam like pureview. Not even sexy like the supeslim design of other brands. Please have a new technology ahead of other.</text>

    <text>Apple is useless in phone making process.the new iphone 5 is so useless.I have this during 6 months ago and doesn't support anything. Main Disadvantages   Aluminum body looks cool but is easy to scratch Proprietary connector, incompatible with previous-gen accessories (needs adapter) The new display is not proportionally bigger, but only taller Unadapted apps run letterboxed due to the unusual resolution nano-SIM support only Apple Maps app not up to scratch No USB Mass Storage mode No FM radio No stereo speakers No microSD card slot No NFC connectivity (though that may be nitpicking) Stuck with iTunes for loading content Mono audio recording in videos   and other things like the user interface which so simple.and the camera contains only HDR,Panoroma and normal capturing.which I hate so much.  After i didn't like it and selled it.Now i have HTC ONE V 'the best phone'.contains every feature in phone and in its Andriod market.I am so happy with HTC.Never buying useless apple again.  Go,for HTC</text>

    <text>apple please remove your restrictions and youll reach very high. you dont even need more features(though add some new features in next ios please.) your perormance and stability is enough reason for people to buy ios devices. i used. 4s and s3(both not latest but good enough) and 4s performs better even s3 has more features. do it soon before android becomes stable please</text>

    <text>Something i would also like to share. Google play doesn't support much of the apps you use like whatsapp, viber, subway surfers (game) in countries in South America whereas Apple Itunessupports any app no matter where you are. Although you have to pay for some apps but using it on ios is better than downloading it on android. So people the best is to go for iphone cause any Apple product has the best performance over all. So stop hesitating between s3 and s4 and go for iPhone 5 :)</text>

    <text>10 good reasons to jailbreak your iPhone, no matter what generation . . . I guess theres a large number of iPhone owners that are still hesitant to jailbreak their iPhones. They consider jailbreaking a dangerous and daunting task that may eventually void their warranty. Since Im on the other side of that barricade, Ive put down a nice list of the 10 new features you will get if you go for jailbreaking. The benefits are more than ten, but Ive compiled the most major ones.  Jailbreaking is a software process that unlocks the access to the iPhone original system files so that you can modify some of them for the better. You shouldnt confuse it with a carrier unlock. Jailbreaking allows us to unleash the true power of the Apples iPhone.  Getting your iPhone jailbroken is like getting a totally different device  at least software-wise. And while I find it next to impossible to resist the tempting new features, I can totally understand you may have perfectly good reasons to keep your iPhone untouched. But hopefully, this list will help you convert.  And a word of warning! This post is not a tutorial in jailbreaking your iPhone. If you need one, a nice place to start is iClarified iPhone section. Installing unofficial third-party apps may cause unwanted side effects so always rely on your good judgment when dealing with those. I am not to be held responsible for any damage you may inflict to your iPhone.  1. Multitasking  The first new benefit from jailbreaking is surely true multitasking. There is a free and a paid app that both offer task switching and management each in its own way. Both depend on a third-party app  the free Backgrounder  to do the minimizing for them. While that may sound complex, switching apps is as easy as it gets.  The free task manager is called Kirikae and shows the running apps as a list. Tapping one will switch to it, while a finger swipe reveals a button to kill the process.  Multifl0w is the paid task manager. It offers the same functionality as Kirikae, but uses a cover-flow-like view for your running apps. Its kinda like the way Safari displays the opened tabs. Multifl0w looks really fancy and even outperforms Palm Pres Card Interface at times.  Lockscreen applications  Thanks to the several available lockscreen applications like LockInfo and IntelliScreen, you can get acess to your calls, messages, calendar events, weather information, etc. straight from the iPhone lockscreen.  Improved messaging  The devil is in the details, they say The iPhone is skimpy on a lot of them details. Delivery reports and a sms character counter are certainly two of those.  With the help of the SMS Helper app you get a nicely integrated character counter, which looks as if Apple made it themselves.  Need delivery reports? The iPhoneDelivery is a simple, but highly useful app thats capable of *delivering* you delivery reports in various customizable ways.  Make ringtones out of your music without iTunes  The iPhone ringtone limitations are quite a bugger. The AnyRing app will set your incoming calls music free of Apple.  You can choose any song from your iPod library, trim it and assign it as a ringtone or alarm tone. The downside is that you have to pay for AnyRing itself (yes, the most innovative unofficial apps are paid).  6. Video recording on iPhone 2G and 3G  You dont have to own an iPhone 3GS to shoot video. Thanks to the Cycorder app you can capture videos at CIF resolution at 15fps, which is way better than that joke of a video recorder in the official AppStore.  7. File access and management  After you jailbreak your iPhone, you have full access to the file system. The iFile app is a popular file manager running directly on your iPhone. It is capable of copying, cutting, moving, renaming and deleting files.  8. Safari file download manager  if youve missed having a way to download files on the iPhone, you may be interested in the Safari download plug-in. Its basically a download manager for the mobile Safari browser. However you will need a file manager to access the files once theyre downloaded.  9. Extended TV-out functionality  If you are tired of the TV-out restrictions in your iPhone, youre in for a nice surprise once you jailbreak your iPhone. The TVOut app is here to help. It enables the TV-out output for all iPhone applications. It has some problems with the landscape apps, but theres another application called Landscape TV Out that fixes that as well. Now imagine playing your iPhone games on a big TV screen.  10. Misc UI improvements  As I mentioned in the beginning of the article, there are a lot of other benefits from jailbreaking. Though none of them is a major thing, I appreciate every single one.  If you happen to own an iPhone 2G or 3G you will most definitely welcome the battery percentage level (3GS-style) that can be enabled via the asBattery app.  Perhaps all iPhone users will appreciate the HapticPro app, which enables vibration touch feedback. The SBSettings app is practical as well. It gives you quick access to various features and its always a single swipe away  some of the functionality it offers is a basic task manager, 3G, Wi-Fi and EDGE switches, respring shortcuts and even more</text>

    <text>Apple products are the best to use and simple! Currently using itouch 5 and it is very much similar to iphone 5.I have planned to buy iphone 5 in coming December...will be using both. Once an apple user always an apple user. I have used Sony Ericsson,Nokia,Samsung and currently using blackberry 8520...bb is just for calls and SMS but all other apps on my itouch 5 You can like and love apple but cannot hate it after using it for a week as it is so much user friendly...apple's each product is worth using...though it is expensive but once you get used to it,it is the best that suits you...apple products have their own class</text>

    <text>What for to have a very big screen if it's always lagging like [not to mention of the name]..Like some of the products especially on smartphones, every of their new products when coming out, there will going to be a little bit bigger in size of the screen than the previous one...what for when it is unfit in your pocket and probably it will going to be uncomfortable + very very weird to carry your smartphone around right?..moreover, samsung also is a fraud as they like to copy others in their production..For me, smartphone with enough functionality and comfortablity is the main aspects that we need to think about when we going to buy them..so, think twice when you gonna buy them..don't just judge the books by its cover...:)</text>

I will wait for iphone 6 and check what it will provide to us. But by the time,  android phone will more and more...</text>

    <text>Iphone 5 is such a great product i've ever used. But just recently i've sold my iphone 5 and bought the galaxy s3.  U wanna know why??? Its not because the iphone. IOS is the reason why i've sold the iphone. I need an open source!!! Since the 6.1.4 upgrade,my iphone becomes useless!!! No more jailbreak. Now im happy with my s3. Yes it does lag. But not too much. At least now i can enjoy my phone. Without rooting im also can download anything from the web,install cracked apps,share things with my friends,native video calling etc. Iphones is a  great device. But the IOS restriction will make u think twice. No doubt IOS is the simple user friendly os. It ls fast,stable, well optimized and have a ton of good quality apps. But without jailbreak, all the idevice is useless!!! Trust me. Im an ios user since the 3gs. It is better on the outside. Not in the inside. Apple does not really care about what peoples need. The only care about their business. By making all the restriction they can generate a ton of profit!!!! Itunes is sucks!!! Apple also sucks!!!! But not the iphones. Iphones is the great quality device.</text>

    <text>How does apple iphone 5 manage the battery to last for 1 day of continues operation having only 1440mAh while others need atlest 3000+ mAh? Considering  with so many apps installed with only 1GB ram in iPhone 5, why it doesn't or minimal lag not like other smartphone with 2GB ram? Questions for those who troll iphone 5 :-)</text>

    <text>Have been using an iphone 5 for about 9 months &amp; am very happy, even though it does not have the specs of the S4, the phone is quick, really quick, no lag, no crashing, the phone has worked perfectly. I don't see why you would want to make it any quicker, it has creamed everything I have thrown at it, HD movies etc, I have seen a S4 in action &amp; would have to say the iphone 5 is only a tiny bit behind the S4 in performance, but with no heavy battery drain &amp; no temp problems. Money well spent, my 2 cents worth.</text>

    <text>I got iPhone 5 64 GB around 2 months back. It is awesome. Absolutely addictive. Android users can never feel what is the meaning of net surfing, gaming, listening to music, etc till they put their hands on an iOs device. The fluid operations of the iOs just make life extremely easy. Pages is the app equivalent to MS Word on iOs or Mac, Keynote is PowerPoint of Apple and Numbers is Excel of Apple. These apps are all as useful on the mobile devices as on a Mac. I had used Android devices and purchased so many Office apps on google play.... But was relieved only after getting the Work app pack on iOs on my iPhone 5 and iPad3 with retina display. The display is extremely beautiful and it is absolutely impossible to take your eyes off ..... You just get stuck to it. Gaming experience as well. No lag, no drag, no crash.... A bit of heat is experienced when too much gaming is done. Battery life is gorgeous with wifi. Continuous chatting on 3 G gives close to 8 hours of life. Facebook chat consumes a lot of battery. Whatsapp or iMessage ( free chat iPhone to iPhone ) .. Actually iMessage is free chat on ios to ios devices... iPod touch/ iPhone / ipad... If you have the money... Just get it... Also see to it that you have a nice collection of cases as it is delicate on the edges... Extremely beautiful.. Best friend... Has replaced my laptop more than 80%... Mail checking is nice... Google search is awesome... Siri is cute. Does everything for you from making a call to putting a status on Facebook! Come out of android... Get an iPhone 5,</text>

    <text>folk on here get it into your heads its our money and we will buy what we want,we are the folk using the phone not you.A phone is subjective to what you want not what others say ,most folk have these fancy smartphones and just talk and text..  I know for well by the way folk talk about iphone that they have never owned one..You cant comment till you have owned one..  This is the iphone 5 forum not S4 or any other droid so what are you doing here?  If you are not interested in iphone why bother or are you really interested..I don't see you in Alcatel forums why not?  If you don't care about Alcatel phones you don't go to their forum same goes for iphone proving fully that all visitors to iphone forums are interested in iphone,psychlogically proved.</text>

    <text>They may bash Apple a countless times, but I can faily say that this phone is still a miles better if you are after a flawless running software.  I've been an on and off Android user, but in the end I always go back to Apple as I get easily annoyed with lagging and app crashing issues.  You might have had a phone with amazing apps with open ware capabilities like Android, but it would be useless if it still gives you an underwhelming hands on experience (hanging, crashing, etc).</text>

    <text>Android is JUNK and highly unoptimized.  Android users are already unsure about S4 pro running 1080p (a awesome quad core) (Xperia Z / Tablet)  They need s600 / s800 before they can be secure.  Plain specs followers.  iPad 3 only have dual core.. and it can support greater then 1080p screen!! and its smooth and fast.  This prove that iOS is very optimized and no need for those high end chip/battery to be usable.  Buy a recent iPhone, and you can be sure you get good performance for at least 2 years and OS update for 3 years.</text>

    <text>Hey friends........Let me give a true idea to you....  IPhone 5 is not a good option according to me.It has good build quality but has low specs and high price.I took iPhone 5 in my hand and I checked it.To be honest, it is not worth it....If it was for 400 USD without contact, it would be great but it is a waste of money at this price...  Better go for something else.Please note that it is not worth it.....</text>

    <text>So true! That's exactly the same way I think about the differences between iOS and android, I have an android, and its hard to find any good apps for free. And most of the &quot;free&quot; apps give me spam ads, even in the notification bar! I also have and iPod4, and I'm always able to find good apps for free. For example, on android, there aren't apps for TV services like TravelChannel, A&amp;E, CBS, and Disney. While on iOS, you can find them all and stream very nicely, without a boatload of ads. This very big difference in app availability is pushing me to switch to an iPhone.</text>

    <text>Most preferred phone in the world for the common people because of the app store.  99% you are using applications, and a phone is only as good as it can run the applications smoothly and save battery when not in use.  Android lacks a good app store, and its dangerous as well.. install wrongly there goes your phone.  If you want to enjoy media/play games/smooth webbrowsing get this phone.</text>

    <text>Jumped from Blackberry to i5 - bad move.  My serial number identified it was a bad phone, but since I didn't call them within 90 days, they want me to pay for the fix!  My first experience with (rotten) Apple will be my last!  No wonder they're getting their butt kicked in the market these days.  If you make something wrong, the warranty should be forever.

    <text>The iPhone 5 is a beautiful, well-crafted smartphone. But at the same time, its lightweight aluminum body may easily bend or scratch if the handset is not handled with care. That explains why there's plenty of protective iPhone 5 cases on the market, ranging from the sleek and barely noticeable, to the tough and extremely durable.</text>

    <text>I have been using Apple Iphone5 for a year now, And this post will give you a brief idea about how iphone5 works after a year. firstly PROS: No lags, Not even a single lag. I think iphone5 has been superior among gaming and the graphics are good.  Screen is highly responsive quick smooth and rugged.  The phone has been outstanding in durability. Its one of the best phones including Motorola defy plus and Sony Active when it comes to durability. With no scratch n a minor dent. The metal framing is tricky but a good cover or bumper can save it.  The phone accessories are still working in the best conditions.  CONS: The phone lock/unlock button has become loose and needs a harder press.  The microphone for phone calls is not that loud. And connectivity is an issue sometimes with 3g also.  Rest the phone is in its best shape may be minor problems but iphone5 still stands 1st rank with the new ios7 and better processor</text>

    <text>The specs speak for themselves. S4 beats iPhone5 in every spec:  - iPhone 5 still using 1.3 GHz dual-core processor? Come on. S4 has 2 quad-core processors (1.6 GHz for intensive processing, and 1.2 GHz for saving battery when not intensive).  - S4 has twice the RAM.  - S4 display has a higher resolution (~441 ppi vs 326 ppi)  - S4 has 13MP camera, iPhone 5 has 8MP camera.  - S4 has the Android stock browser and Chrome browser, much better than Safari.  - S4 has Android, a superior operating system that is open, allows Java and Flash to run, and gives you access to many free services that you need to pay for if you use iOS.  Samsung Galaxy S4 beats iPhone5 hands down.</text>

    <text>When did ip5 go to 1.3GHZ?..i missed that.  Apple haters complain iPhone 5 have poor specs vs samsung galaxy s4. or note2.  But when it comes to using application iphone5 is faster.. So whats the point of specs if it does not help in performance?  Exactly whats been said for years.Iphone is consistently ,consistent consistently.  Are Apple about to blow us away with something new this year or keep the same and disappoint us.They really need to up their game because this iphone has to last another year bringing it to Sept 2014 and by then SO much will have happened ,even new O/S out.</text>

    <text>I have had my Apple iPhone 5 for 6 months. I haven't been rough with it. Today my email froze. When I called support they told me I couldn't speak to a technician because I didn't have AppleCare. The phone is less than a year old and expensive. There is no reason why I should pay to get advice over the phone about what might be wrong. I am getting less and less happy with Apple as a company.</text>

    <text>Why everybody has bad perception on apple product?  Iphone 4 - 26,000INR US$438  Iphone 5 -45,500INR US$767  So according to your wants you can decide for storage 16,32,64  Reason for higher price is  Build Quality  One year replacement warranty for mobile and accessories. Any hardware issue just replacement in three days so no dismantle or repair.  SO YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID.</text>

    <text>Hope there is also waterproof smart watch camera phone from Apple like what LG did last 2010. Sony made a bluetooth watch where you need your real smart phone within your range but its not as good as what LG did where you can insert a different sim card to ensure to receive all important calls and messages as well as instantly sending messages and making calls. Its a very useful device for active people who spend their day most on sports like swimming running dancing and other physical activities which I do not understand why only less cellphone manufacturers follow LG with this concept.</text>

    <text>if you're fun of surfing you're definitely wrong on choosing IPHONE5. Iphone 5 has the overheating problem when using data network. It gets hot even if you use data on a short period of time. Battery Life is also a problem. You can actually charge the phone two times a day. But resolution is good but totally IPHONE 4s is much better than IPHONE5.</text>

Apple fanboys are pathetic and in denial. They they're so called best phone has fallen long ago to s3 and note2's might. These apple eaters are sleeping with their open eyes.so please don't fight with ip5...or its users..cause in any aspect they and their product is not even worthy to compare with us and our ethical gadgets. Like I said before. ..smartphone is for smart people and apple isn't even justified as a smartphone. ...what my note can do. ..ip5 can never do that. .ever. ..</text>

You can just put it in your pocket easily, long life battery, camera i'll rate it 5 . Everything apple did in this phone is perfect . No other phone can match iphone5. So stop those annoying questions just go buy iphone5. :)</text>

    <text>Personally I would not purchase an IPhone because I cannot justify spending the money on one. That does not mean that the product sucks, it is all about personal preference. I have an iPod which is no iPhone, but I can understand why iPhone users love their iPhones. Yes they are using similar features as previous iPhones, but why change the design or the interface if it works well as it is. Sometimes changing things does not always work well. Hats of to Apple for making something people love, and for making other companies to step up in their game.</text>

    <text>Iphones are boring if you compare therm to s3 or s4. But once they are jailbroken, wow. Theyre the best! Better than s3 and s4. So ill stick to iphone forever. Fyi jailbreaking your iphone voids warranty. But im very careful with my phone so who cares.</text>

    <text>Hello Apple,  I believed that the quality of your phones is excellent. But why not try to increase a little bit its size?Something like 4.3&quot; or 4.5&quot;,also try to improve your features,because its a little bit boring,unlike android,so friendly in features.</text>

    <text>ya Mr techno j, tcool is free to express anythings he wants, and u shouldn't attack him this way, plz respect people opinions. surely apple has some problems such as the size of the screen, the sound is too low, the card memory reader doesn't exist the density of pixels is too small ...etc, by the way apple must take these opnions seriously to increase its products and selling them... see u</text>

    <text>I have used at least 4 android phones, they all suck, HTC Sensation, HTC Droid DNA (Worst phone ever, I get sim card not inserted error atleast 5 times a day), HTC Incerdible S and Inspire 4G. None of them lasted on a  full charge for more that 8 hours or so before they were down to 20% or less charge.  Switched to iphone 5, been using for 3 weeks, love it a lot, threw away my android phone and tab. Will never ever go back to android.</text>

    <text>I had the iPhone 5 along with the S4 to compare both. I still can't believe people choose this junk. Design is awesome, but c'mon, a 1.2GHz Dual-core with 1Gb of RAM is more expensive than an 2GB dual-quad-core? I don't know why would you choose a device that will be completely useless in 3-4 years time.</text>

    <text>iPhone might have bad specs to most giant phones. But its collection of apps is what makes it worth while!  S4 might have good hardware.. the apps on the play store are junk!  Games/Social/Web/Video/Music still iPhones best. (not just iPhone5)  Stick with android you will forever be upgrading and tweaking to no end!.. Draining your battery and life together!</text>

    <text>On a side note, I couldnt help but notice that Apples new Iphone iteration due for an Autumn release features something very similar to Jollas ambience function  coincidence, I think not. In IOS7, it appears that by changing the wallpaper on the homescreen, you also change the look and feel of the phone which seems (like the ambience feature in Sailfish) to reflect the colours in your wallpaper image.  A lot of the other features in IOS7 seem to have been heavily influenced by MeeGO, Web OS and many other operating systems. There go Apple again taking from others and calling it their own!  So lets support the real innovators and help get Jolla up there with the big boys!  Sail On</text>

It will still be the most talked about mobile in the world because of its premium product. And other brands will be talked about on how they try to deminish iphone. No wonder why apple dont give such ammount of effort to compete with other brands. They are too strong enough to be destroyed. What more if apple will release some products that can rival samsungs gimmiky features. Alot of people will still choose apple after they have tried other brands. You just cant kill them. Iphone will be iphone and other phone brands will be just phones. Long live apple.</text>

    <text>To those who are planning to get this phone, guys Galaxy S4 is much better than iPhone 5. Try to review their specs. You can see that S4 has much more to offer for your lifestyle and entertainment interest.  S4 is  better: Quadcore CPU Larger Screen size Greater Graphic capability Better camera than i5  ty to review their specs. iPhone has become popular because of Jobs. But now? God.. try to look at the iOS 7 which is the latest iOS, it looks like Android of something like Picassa theme.. Steve Job's unique style is missing.. just a comment..</text>

    <text>At first I bought iP5 - my first (and only) apple/smartphone device - then I read most of your comments. I have to admit I was terrified that I made the worst choice ever, after I read about all the potential faults of this phone. I even left the phone in the box for a week without opening it (pls, don't laugh at me). Finally, I started using it. It is just great. My device doesn't have any defect, my sister's neither. I am very happy with it. If only it had a FM radio (tiresome request, I know). But still it is the best user experience ever.</text>

    <text>based on my experience just this morning, I had encountered some lag issues with ip5 when im playing minion rush though not a problem at all, probably it really happens to all phones. but compared with my old phone (xperia go) i highly recommend ip5 above all phones which are in the market.</text>

I wanna move from android to ios but dammit i cnt decide either to move or not ! Htc one ! Or i5 !</text>

    <text>Great Phone dont get me wrong but the build quality was very poor compared to the iphone 4s i mean on the iphone 5 both colours the paint comes off and chips without the phone being dropped or anything people will claim this is just wear and tear but any other phone the paint does not come off. very dissapointed sold my iphone 5 and got a htc one for the decent build quality</text>

    <text>It really depends on what you want. If you want the best apps (free and paid) with very little lag and a great overall camera then iPhone 5 is for you. If you want a iPhone lookalike with great customization options and most great apps with a great low-light camera with front speakers then HTC One is for you.</text>

    <text>U WILL NEVER KNOW ABOUT iPhone UNTIL U USE IT !  i was no fan of iPhone, its a very expensive and with limited connectivity and file management system. i thought it a Shit !  BUT now i use iPhone 5 and i decided hear after i will only use  iPhone ! its the best !  i have used Blackberry, Android (Samsung, Sony, HTC), Windows, Linux so on.... and i never get the performance of iPhone in any other phone.  i agree Samsung S4 have very hi hardware configuration, But the performance is poor...! cannot even compare with iPhone.  the Smart phone should be Smart, not very huge with 5 inch screen.....  iPhone is handy, smart, tough, and only this i want more is Water/Dust proof, maybe in next generation we will get it.....  iPhone fans cheer . . . .!</text>

    <text>Sold my 4s for 200GBP Saturday and got a second hand sgs3..Its so boring to look at and screen is not as bright as my sgs2..There is so much stuff on it and pretty complex and i keep getting &quot;memo stopped working&quot; even after reset..It took me ages to get it set up again unlike iphone where you just restore..The trouble with titanium back up is if you get a bad app titanium will redownload all the problems making a reset and restore useless..  Anyhow Android has its good bits but after 2 days i want an iphone back..Yes i wish it had micro sd slot for cheap memory upgrade and bluetooth transfer but ios just works and consistantly smooth even with 84 apps open(thats the maximun i have).  I dont know what to do as new iphone due soon,,will look around second hand shops today for cheap 4 or 4s to put me on..I do this all the time i get feeling for Android buy one and stick my 64gb card in get it set up then struggle with it..I then want iphone back.  Android phones are too big but all top of range Androids are big,4.3 inch screen with thin bezel is my maximum size..</text>

This is not a hardware issue with d iphone. Please insert another sim from a supported carrier or request that this iphone be UNLOCKED by your carrier. Please contact Apple for more information.

    <text>In an effort to be more transparent, Apple has released for the first time specific information about its final assembly facilities.  While Apple published a list of its supply makers last year, the new information gives more details about where each Apple product is made. The tech giant named the 17 factories where its products are assembled and packaged and also named which product is assembled at each facility and where that facility is located. All but one of the suppliers is owned by a Taiwanese company, and 14 of the 17 factories are located in China.  (Read More: Foxconn Challenged as Global Reach Grows )  Apple also revealed that the Taiwanese company Hon Hai Precision Industrycommonly known as Foxconnowns assembly plants for iPhones and iPads. (Read More: In Asia's Trend-Setting Cities, iPhone Fatigue Sets In )  Criticism of working conditions at Hon Hai has put pressure on Apple to increase transparency about where its products are made.  (Read More: Apple Supplier Foxconn Shares Hit After Factory Brawl )  (Read More: Foxconn Admits Employing 14-Year-Old Interns )  There is one assembly plant located in the U.S., which is owned by the Taiwanese company Quanta Computer, that assembles Mac Computers.</text>

    <text>It was a blow to realize that the iPhone 5 I bought last week did not have 16x9 aspect ratio for photos to go with the wide screen on the phone.  Virtually everything today is going wide screen, even the video camera in the iPhone. Right now I'd like to go back to my iPhone 4 and carry my Canon, but that phone is gone and I'm stuck with a phone with photos sized for old monitors and CRT TVs. I'm not happy with Apple's lagging on this.</text>

    <text>BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE...iphone is the best for me! have switched to S3 from Ip4s and then to IP5...then just recently to S4 I9505 LTE, barely 2 weeks and i am back to IP5...the feel,the touch, the look, the DURABILITY and most importantly the USE...it is DEFINITELY IP5...no question  to some it may be otherwise, but speaking for myself...IT IS THE BEST in the market, TRULY a CLASS above the rest IP5 is a phone and the extras it carries with it are just bonuses....if you need a high megapixel camera GO BUY A CAMERA, a gaming station get one and not a phone....high speed internet get a laptop...and so forth and so on IF YOU ARE AN ANDROID FAN...then you are not supposed to be here...</text>

    <text>I'm so glad that I've chosen iPhone. It doesn't lag, really fast Internet connection, I really like the design and portability, simple yet elegant. I was really confused before what to choose, iPhone or Samsung. I have asked some of my friends, most of them suggested to choose Samsung but my friends who are iPhone users said that iPhone is better. My first choice was iPhone because S4 is too wide and I like iPhone's size better. The only thing about iPhone is you can't share files to other phones and the battery, it drains faster than other phones especially if you access 3G. But still, iPhone is iPhone and I'm glad I've chosen this phone &amp;#128516;</text>

    <text>iPhone 5 has 1GB of RAM and Galaxy S4 has 2GB. But when you run and open apps/games,they both have the same speed! even if the iPhone 5 has lower specs. iOS is still the best when it comes to processing speed. Android have lags but in iOS i dont feel a thing.iPhone 5 benchmark rating is good,but the S4 is the best. And S4 wins when it comes to features but i dont actually use them that much. S4 has a larger screen which is not that portable compare to iPhone 5. I5 fits in my pocket and i like it, but s4? too wide for my pocket. iPhone 5 and iOS is simply amazing. Great phone when it comes to speed and portability.</text>

    <text>Apple is for classes not for masses. Don't compare iOS with Android. If Apple wants they can release low-cost iPhone long time ago. Apart from Google Nexus no android phone is smooth or out of lag. Even Galaxy S4 also lags. And also all other android phone apart from nexus comes with lot of bloat ware. Now a days Microsoft/Nokia Devices are good and out of lag. But long way to go. On June 29, 2007, Apple released the first version of what became iOS  concurrently with the first iPhone. Android 1.0, the first commercial version of the software, was released on 23 September 2008, approx 13 months later than iOS. So please guys don't compare Android with iOS.</text>

Android is still the king.</text>

    <text>I am running iOS7. I have had every iphone ever and have also been a blackberry user. Generally a cell phone nerd to be honest. I was excited to install the iOS as I was looking forward to a revamped look at the new features. After 24h I want to revert. The beta is extremely stable so this has nothing to do with bugs or anything. The look is just very young, and has taken apple closer to Android / Windows but in the worse way possible. People who bought iPhones bought them to belong to a certain brand, that had a defined look and yes the Androids of this world always had better features but that was not the point. Now when I look at my iphone, I don't feel like I have an Apple product anymore. Apple was uncompromising under Jobs, &quot;take it or leave it&quot;. With this new design, Apple is not innovating, they are turning in another the direction and following the pack. I never thought I would say this in 2013, but blackberry may have a play to make here in wooing serious phone users, people who want a unique UI, and people who just like to differentiate themselves from the mass. I understand why Steve Jobs was against the flat design that John Ivey was pushing for so much. He understood that it wasn't about accessing the flashlight on the lockscreen (ios7 has that), it was about belonging to a defined brand with a defined identity.</text>

    <text>Hi Guys all you are talking about quad core,ram &amp; size of the screen.Thats not the things you have to check about.you have to see whether it works to its specs.Thats where we come to apple iphones.In previous models they have been giving 800mhz processor &amp; 256 ram but the things is it wont get slow even if apps runs in background.i tested that with more than 20 apps running in the background.still its fast.you have to understand its about their ios software.and most of you guys know that for movie editing apple pc is only used. cause its about the pixel depth.No screen can compare to those apple products.there screen is the main thing thats y they have given the retina display which no one else has given in phones. and the graphics its always outstanding they are using triple core graphics.and for battery try and see it.you guys itself knows some technical details about battery.what about the apples R&amp;D Department? think.the battery may be 1440 mah.there software dosent use up all the battery resources.in android you are using battery saver or some apps.but they are in built thats y i am saying try and see it guys.apple iphone is not like any other products.they are not releasing every month a model.they dedicate they lifes to create the best one even if it takes a year or five.they try to give  the best guys.the only thing that truly lacks is bluetooth it can only send from apple to apple.other than that.its the best.</text>

    <text>How much of an iPhone is made by Samsung?  APPLE doesn't make the iPhone itself. It neither manufactures the components nor assembles them into a finished product. The components come from a variety of suppliers and the assembly is done by Foxconn, a Taiwanese firm, at its plant in Shenzhen, China. The teardown graphic below, based on data from iSuppli, a market-research firm, shows who makes what inside the iPhone, and how much the various bits cost. Samsung turns out to be a particularly important supplier. It provides some of the phone's most important components: the flash memory that holds the phone's apps, music and operating software; the working memory, or DRAM; and the applications processor that makes the whole thing work. Together these account for 26% of the component cost of an iPhone.  This puts Samsung in the somewhat unusual position of supplying a significant proportion of one of its main rival's products, since Samsung also makes smartphones and tablet computers of its own. Apple is one of Samsung's largest customers, and Samsung is one of Apple's biggest suppliers. This is actually part of Samsung's business model: acting as a supplier of components for others gives it the scale to produce its own products more cheaply. For its part, Apple is happy to let other firms handle component production and assembly, because that leaves it free to concentrate on its strengths: designing elegant, easy-to-use combinations of hardware, software and services.</text>

    <text>used almost all famous android phones(galaxy s 1,2,3,4, Htc desire s, one x, one s, desire hd, sony xperia u, s and all ios Phones except iphone 3gs..  here in pakistan u can have a unlocked phone, use it for a while and then u can sell it in market in a good price and opt for other one... so i used these all phones in this context..  My experience about android is (1) it is heavy OS, consumes more ram, and storage + battery to provide u adequate experience e.g in( games, and daily ui interaction)(Laggy thoug)  recently bought galaxy s4 = Lags like Hell&gt; camera app most of the time restarted the phone and gaming experiencing still not par with ios even after having Octa core Processor and yet so fragile phone, i dropped my mine from my back pocket on the road and almost all the frame aside of screen got dents and bruises and saw many shattered s4's screens in market already so i sold it( remember i bought it after selling my iphone 5)   Iphone 5= u will not believe it i bought it 2 times and sold it to enjoy the android experience but at the end  i always come to the point the in daily routine droid phones sucks crashes all the time so now i m again about to buy an apple device becoz of its stability and class.  iphone does all my daily needs with ease e.g phone app is much more faster to open in ios than in android same to the other apps e.g mssgng.. battery is cool and standby time of iphone 5 is no match to the droids ..its amazing  i am waiting to buy new iphone or iphone 5 in september ....ios 7= cool</text>

    <text>who cares about technical specification if the phone runs smooth? the difference performance-wise between 4S and 5 is hardly noticeable, as iphone runs smooth from the first iphone. unlike android, that needs monster-hardware to run &quot;better&quot;. i'm an android user, but never satisfied with my phone. i keep upgrading my phone to a better one, one with better specs, still it lags.</text>

    <text>I was iPhone user and used to thing that iPhone is best smartphone on planet. Then, one day I saw Galaxy Note, I liked its look &amp; big screen. At that time I was fully satisfied with iPhone but I took risk and purchased Galaxy Note. After using Galaxy Note I realized the power of android smartphone. Android gives tremendous options to customize phone and its all free. I found iPhone is just a toy in front of Galaxy Note. iPhone is good for people who just want to make calls and do simple tasks and want to pay for each new feature.</text>

    <text>hi guys last night my iphone screen suddenly went black like it is dead. no function or key or any charging was working. Then I searched from net where it was adviced to perform reset by pressing sleep and home button simultaneously.I did that and my iphone started. The same thing happened after 5 minutes again. I again performed a reset by repeating the process and after the device is working fine till now. Is there any issue to worry for? Should I visit service centre or is it normal? Pls reply soon. I m worried</text>

    <text>Dear Friends After i sold my 4S year back shifted to android used S3,Note 2 and thought about to buy S4 but came back to Iphone5  Android good platform but hang and lags lot.Sometimes get stuck we have to reset. Lots of bugs,Lots of unwanted advertisement while using apps,Lots of apps but low quality.Example when we install a particular App from play store we can see two to three unwanted apps get installed along with it and we can view it on home screen. Samsung When they released S3 it was US$700 during 2012 but today S3 cost around US$480(Quality remains same) same way S4 within a month around US$80 was reduced.So who ever buy the mobile at release are fooled. Apple Excellent built quality,Good quality apps,No hang or lags,Price wont get reduce suddenly like samsung, IOS 6.1.2 had good battery backup but now 6.1.4 sucks even though am waiting for IOS7 which will be a best IOS ever.Apple for ever</text>

    <text>the iPhone 5 has a great display. But with the 1080p panels on the htc one/galaxy s4, Apple will need to step up.  The 1080p displays (minus the xperia z) are very,very good looking and better then the iPhone 5. Please make atleast a 720p or even better a 1080p :).  And yes, I have a iphone 5.</text>

    <text>Hey friends - Just found out an easy way to use personalised ringtones instead of the proprietory ones installed in the iphone 5 without using itunes. Simply download the free version of 'Xilisoft iPhone Ringtone Maker 3.0.10 build 20121111' from the Xilisoft homepage. Install it in the pc then find the serial no. from google for the above mentioned version. Now follow the steps mentioned within the software. Try it, it's really easy.</text>

    <text>I recently purchased the iphone 5. I am sorry i bought it! Should've waited for the HTC one, but ah well. I'm not a fan of the operating system at all, to basic and nothing like an android. I am scared to drop this thing. Not robust and strong. Only thing I honestly do like is how lightweight it is.</text>

    <text>I would never buy another iPhone 5. The phone does not ring, and Apple wants me to pay $69.99, which is a discounted fee, in order to have them fix a 6 month old phone that doesn't ring. To me, that makes no sense, especially seeing as this will only guarantee it for 30 days.</text>

    <text>HTC , Samsung and other android devices produces phones which have loads of feature but you hardly use them. and worst of all android phones drains out the battery very quick with compare to iOS. iPhone5 all the way. Simple, straight forward and all the features are for your use.</text>

    <text>Had it 48 hrs now its white one...Its not first iphone 5 had black one when first come but sent it back had 2 chips in it.  Is nippier than 4s if you can believe it, its opens bejewelled 6 seconds earlier..I use 3d bench mark and;  4s=time to run it 18.1 seconds at 27.56 FPS 5=time to run it 11.53 seconds at 43.25 FPS  It feels like when I moved from iphone 4 to 4s you think 4 is smooth and fast but each iteration brings speed inprovements..Camera is faster and video in low light drops no frames and is fluid.  Battery life feels same with 12% left about 7pm at night ready for night charge ready for 7am next morning.I would say I am medium user but hammer any smartphone and it will last 3-4hrs except razr maxx or Note.  I cant tell photos are any better its all about good light and keeping lens clean they are just fine and does me..Video I am interested in and its very good and so is audio through headphones but speaker crackles/distorts a bit at full blast whereas 4s does not.  Overall if I was advising anyone I would still go for the more robust 4s and save money.If you want latest and bigger screen go for 5 it is more 2013 than 4s.I did a deal on my 5 and would advise anyone with money to buy 5 to wait and see what 5s/6 brings,may as well its not far off.  You are sort of getting the same thing whether you use 4s or 5 but iphone 4 camera is terrible it ruined so many shots I could not recommend it unless don't care about cam and just want to try iphone for first time.</text>

The built quality is great but it fails on drop or torture tests that I've watched, infact Samsung and their supposedly cheapish built survives much better. So why the million dollar price tags?????????</text>

    <text>Let's go back to the classic days of 4s Eventually Designed Under Steve's Management It was Called the Fast 4ward Phone A great Mark For Speed.Iphone 5 Brings You a Bit Out of Iphone lines As the model hs be Stretched to about 4.2 or 4.3 inches Kills users with its looks, It's work on the rear is simply awesome The width Remain Unchanged due to one hand usage But Iphone 5 is the slimmest and Lightest phone Designed By Apple, and I have Recently updated it to Ios 6.1.3 And its Triple core Graphics Enables A super Streamline of Gameplay Making it a Favorite phone Applicable to All, Without Age Limits The disadvantages are In times of Quad Core Systems it has 1.2 GHz Dual core engine Powered in Apple A6 Chipset It has been also noted as the Iphones first LTE phone and NFC Makes Iphone complete My Recomendation is to Buy If you can Afford it Atleast have a wifi In Home For best performence.</text>

    <text>Hi Guys &amp; Gals, I have a serious difficulty choosing between Iphone 5 and Xperia Z. I hope you can give me your sincere opinion. I used the Iphone 5 that I got as a gift for 3 months before losing it in a taxi. Now I need to replace this phone today. I stumbled upon the Xperia Z in a store and it seemed cool both from the looks and the features that Sony claimed it boasts. I am confused as I am now not sure whether to go for the Iphone 5 or the Xperia Z. Can those who have had the opportunity of using both phones help me by stating which one they'd go for and for what reason? Your help will be most appreciated.</text>

    <text>The phone is great especially for web browsing and its so fast and quite easy to work.  The only major bad thing about this phone is the battery life.  With all the functions the phone has you want to use it all the time like a computer but battery life is so poor i have to have a battery charger on me all the time.  It wont even last half a day if your using it alot.  They should have made it thicker to add a bigger battery life.  It needs to be doubled in order to be up to the standard of the phones capabilities.</text>

    <text>The best phone. I believe it is still the fastest phone in the market right now. You cant compare that to android. I used to have 4s. After using it for a year and a half. The performance is still the same. FAST!! all i need in an smartphone is in my iphone 5 i dont need no air gestures or remote to my tv. Samaung is just putting that things on their phones to impress buyers. But you cant really use them everyday. Iphone is durable. Reliable. And simply smart enough for real smart people. Peace samsung.</text>

    <text>Hey guys...If u wanna know a real and unbiased opinion, then read this. In terms of usability and reliability, just go for iphone 5.  Iphone 5 hardware maybe low compared to most high end android phones; iOS makes better out of it. iphone 5 may only have 1Gig of ram but most 3d games runs smoothly in iOS than a 2Gig ram on android.  Apple products have only one disadvantage, proprietary.  If you don't mind the bucks and only care for quality in both hardware and software; go for iphone 5.</text>

    <text>To choose a smartphone, you should know your preference first. I personally think that iOS is an better OS as it's smoother, simpler to operate, better apps quality, and apple did long term software support for each iDevice unlike most of the other android devices. Although it has only duo core, but definitely, it has higher ability to run great games (some 2GB games with superb graphic), apps and even some fascinating jailbreak tweaks. I love android too, just state what are the advantages of an iPhone. enjoy!</text>

    <text>Hey! I got my iphone 5 as a birthday gift. That was about 1 month ago. Until then i ve never had an iphone. Been using nokia since 2000. I could choose between s4 s3 and htc one. I took a good friends advice and settled with the iphone. I honestly must say that im amazed. The camera on the phone is brilliant, it records like a video camera. Also its really easy and intuitive to use. Everything seems to be where t should. Android based phones are more juiced up lets say but the feel and usage of the iphone are unbelivable. Furthermore it doesnt lag, i can open all my apps and still get the same response ehen wrtting an email or playing a video game. I have some cons also. The baterry life is poor in my opinion, you can use the phone for just one day with wifi and 3g on. Ive been used with my e72 which could go on for a matter of several days. Besides that the iphone 5 is the best phone for me. Hope ive helped people who are in doubt on what to buy! Cheers from romania!</text>

    <text>best phone ive ever had, way better than the android based phone. it NEVER LAG even if the storage is full thanks to the iOS. I also highly recommend to jailbreak it so you can customize the phone however you like so it brings you a lot of new features and tweaks</text>

    <text>There have been numerous rumors claiming that Apple is working on an iPhone with a larger screen to compete with phones from competitors like Samsung, but Tim Cook's comments during today's Q2 financial results call indicate that the company is not quite ready to make a phone with a 5-inch screen. My view continues to be that iPhone 5 has the best display in the industry. We always strive to create the very best display. Some customers value large screen size. Others value other factors such as resolution, color quality, white balance, reflectivity, power consumption, compatibility of apps, and portability. Our competitors have made some significant tradeoffs in many of these areas to ship a larger display. We would not ship a larger display iPhone while these tradeoffs exist. It appears that Apple will not be releasing an iPhone with a larger screen until the company's manufacturing partners can supply it with a 5-inch screen that meets its demanding criteria.</text>

    <text>Well this phone wouldn't be too bad, because it has nice UI, etc, but it is poor quality, indeed only 1 year warranty, plus this is way too overpriced for it's value, there are better products from competition that have better quality, they even sell it for smaller price. So to sum up, a great phone, but not worth it's money, however if you like Apple, you might not have much of a choice.</text>

    <text>The &quot;iPhone 5&quot; is the very best &amp; &amp; &amp; the worst iPhone ever too! Its full of problems. Very first unite was defective with its aluminum unibody i.e. dent, broken sleep/wake button, purple tint on camera. Now first unit's issues has been gone &amp; new issues has been introduced i.e. slow to respond or hangs home &amp; sleep/wake button, camera not functioning randomly or permanently.  Here is my experiences with iPhone 5: 1. I have brought an iPhone 5 (most provably one of the first unite) immediately when its was released with some dents. After two or three months I got problem with sleep/wake button. It was broken due to very soft material used on it. 2. So, then Apple had changed my iPhone with new one. Surprisingly that one had not any dent &amp; I noticed they have changed the sleep/wake, silent buttons &amp; the volume rocker with different materials which is more dark (black) and hard. But I discovered a big issue that, the home and the sleep/wake buttons was not responding randomly. The screen went off &amp; couldn't be turned on due to not responding buttons. 3. Again, Apple had replaced my iPhone with new one. That time camera didn't work. So, I had sent that to the Apple again. 4. And Yes, they have change that again with another new device without asking any question. But after two days I have gotten the problem again that is &quot; the home and the sleep/wake buttons was not responding randomly&quot; and this time is more frequeint!  So, now what should I do? Will I go to Apple's Genius Bar again to get another new faulty device???</text>

    <text>iPhone5 is still made the same way like a decade ago: made from cheap aluminum,totally super cheap material.  whereas the current smartphones are made from ultra durable super premium synthetic ceramic; iphone5 uses ordinary glass; whereas some are now using indestructible japanese asahi glass. iphone5 still uses the obsolete A5 chip only in dual core. whereas most are using high tech snapdragon chips. iphone5 os is still the obsolte ios a decade ago. Blackberry 10 is the best, followed by android; where as apple os is very far behind, say ten steps backwards. most of all iphones are made in some decrepit cottage industry in bangladesh the subcontractor of foxconn. and then sold one million times profit margin from its actual manufacturing cost of just over thirty dollars US$30. if you come to asia, you will see macbooks and iphones sold in the side street but no takers even sold at dirt cheap buy one take one because it sucks</text>

    <text>Hi every body, as I saw ur opinions that sounds good but here u go. I bought iPhone-5 on 4th of May-2013 it has a great performance and awesome. We must care with it cuz it's not a 20$ phone it's an expensive phone and we need to care with it. From first u buy iPhone u must buy a mobile case with it to protect it from damage.

    <text>First time user of iPhone 5 after many years of being a Blackberry user. Wish I was a little more patient and waited for the BB Z10. Mechanically the iPhone is great but software wise it is well short of expectation. Battery lasts a day at best.No file manager for starters and the list goes on. A huge disappointment after all the media hype. Common Apple, give the consumer what they want instead of milking us at every opportunity , iTunes et al !!!!   Disgusted</text>

    <text>iPhone is definitely the best phone in the market.It has a better app store than Android's Google Play.I tried using my cousin's Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos and when I tried to download Temple Run,a bunch of useless apps came with the Temple Run download.It really sucks.And also,when I tried surfing Facebook on it (My cousin didn't download the official Facebook app because she said it takes too much memory,which I understand so I decided to use the built-in Internet app instead.) And it lags like HELL! I'm not used to surf on lag devices so,I closed the app.What brags me the most is that my non-Android phone,Samsung Corby II (This is a budget phone) surfs smoother than her Android device although there's like 4 apps running in the background.I also tried my friend's iPhone 5 and it doesn't lag at all! :D</text>

    <text>The &quot;iPhone 5&quot; is the very best &amp; &amp; &amp; the worst iPhone ever too! Its full of problems. Very first unite was defective with its aluminum unibody i.e.  dent, broken sleep/wake button, purple tint on camera. Now first unit's issues has been gone &amp; new issues has been introduced i.e. slow  to respond or hangs home &amp; sleep/wake button, camera not functioning randomly or permanently.  Here is my experiences with iPhone 5: 1. I have brought an iPhone 5 (most provably one of the first unite) immediately when its was released with some dents. After two or three months I got problem with sleep/wake button. It was broken due to very soft material used on it. 2. So, then Apple had changed my iPhone with new one. Surprisingly that one had not any dent &amp; I noticed they have changed the sleep/wake, silent buttons  &amp; the volume rocker with different materials which is more dark (black) and hard. But I discovered a big issue that, the home and the sleep/wake buttons was not responding randomly. The screen went off &amp; couldn't be turned on due to not responding buttons. 3. Again, Apple had replaced my iPhone with new one. That time camera didn't work. So, I have sent that to the Apple again. 4. Now I'm waiting for another new iPhone 5 provably with some new issues. to be continued...</text>

    <text>Ok apple where is iphone money spent cause glass whether gorilla or not cost nothing,,that bit of stainless steel will cost you nothing per iphone..You are using a battery and chips everyone else is using so why so expensive??  Well you admitted it you overcharge your customers,,actually you rob them blind..I f you turn round and said our O/ is expensive to complete so we will overcharge for that its still wrong answer..  If your next iphone is not a big wow you are going to really see a dent in your robbing constomer profits..RANT OVER,FOR NOW.</text>

    <text>Next iphone I want.  Half press shutter button to lock auto-focus,super fast auto-focus in video recording,minimum 1.6GHz dual core CPU with quadcore GPU ,xenon and LED flash,LED notification light,memory card slot,equaliser in music app not buried in settings,notification.toggles in drop down menu..and so on..I have come to live with sealed in battery but 500mA extra wouldn't go a miss and bluetooth transfer is what i want but micro sd slot is must.  I would like to see kevlar back and strongest smudge resistant glass available on front..16 megapixel cam with Nokia S60 settings carl zeiss optics and periscope optical 3x zoom,back button moved to bottom of device,bit wideer device iphone5 looks odd even tho apple want to keep it this width,2 speakers not one other is microphone,headfone jack back on top,slightly curved like Samsung NexusS S that was a stealth looking device,slide shutter lens cover,reverb settings and custom equalizer ,slide out T9 or qwerty real button keypad or D-PAD for precision scrolling about and proper send/end keys,,many coulors to choose from,fm transmitter.  That will do for now but see some of the room for improvement..</text>

Went back to the iphone but got the 5, so pleased to be back with my apple phone, I will never change from apple iphone now as I would never make that mistake again.</text>

    <text>Well, the iPhone 5 is a good enough phone for the casual user, who only wants to call others, make occasional photos,surf the web, and use mainstream apps. But its price tag, especially for this hardware, is quite inflated.  However, and this WILL come as a shock for many, the iPhone 5 is NOT a smartphone in its own right (at least from my point of view). This is because iOS does not have certain features. In my mind for a device to be considered a smartphone, it's OS should have true multitasking, app integration, a system-wide file manager, as well as an application market. As iOS doesn't actually have the first 3 features (despite all of Apple's propaganda), it should only be regarded as a semi-smartphone.  Don't get me wrong, for 95+% of users, a semi-smartphone is more than enough to satisfy their needs. This combined with its good looks, the absence of lags(unlike Android, which is a true, if very heavy OS), huge numbers of apps, as well as very aggresive marketing on the part of Apple, has ensured that every iPhone will sell well. Don't get me wrong, I liked the iPhone 5 initially but after 2 months I got rid of it and turned to Android. The iPhone would be a great device if it were to cost about 400 Euros at launch.</text>

They should go and get help from a Physiatrist if they afford . Otherwise try to be make themselves happy with Whatever they afford or got. Sorry Guys</text>

    <text>Acting like that towards people with genuine criticism just makes people want to criticise more out of spite for the intolerance of people like you, and with my last comment I had something to say and I said it, and just out of spite for your intolerance I could easily flood this section with my own posts because of you and ruin it for everyone else but that depends on how you treat people who have criticism from now on.</text>

    <text>Well iPhone 5 is a Great Phone after all and it's the best most beauty smartphone that i ever had. I think we can't to comparing iPhone 5 with SGS3 because their OS is different. I mean, if iOS is an open source just like an Android and SGS with that specs use an iOS, than the SGS is The Unbeatable SmartPhone! Because the iPhone 5 with an iOS and it's Dual Core processor is can to compete the SGS3 with an android and it's huge Quad Core processor.  And when i look the SGS4 specs, it makes me thing that apple must be create the superior iPhone to beat the SGS4 :|</text>

    <text>There are only two that i would like for apple to do. First they should add sdcard slot in order to expand the memory; the one was, they should increase the display size of coming iphones. Increase of size but moderately. Even not on par with the samsungs 5 to 6 inches cause they were too big to handle. 4.8 inches would be the most appropriate size of smartphone.</text>

    <text>if u want super phone when u have an iphone you should wait for untethered jailbreak to maximize the power of any iphone, you can do all you want. i have an iphone 5 (factory unlock) its version is 6.1.2 &amp; untethered jailbroken (not the tethered one), if you know the application in cydia, you must say that its worth it &amp; dont regret for the money you spend for it.</text>

    <text>Bro, everything, I mean camera, apps and games, music, reading- everything is fine about iPhone 5. I own one with 32 GB and trust me, I have been using more than 745 apps and games since I have brought it. Yea, I wish it has 4.5' display and battery is not the best but not too bad. If you need full usage with battery then you should try lumia but, being lover of easy installation and using awesome apps and games, I prefer iPhone and iPad.</text>

    <text>The truth and honest opinion from my experience.i was using galaxy s3 for 8 month.but I wasn't that much happy.cause although I have updated it to Jb there is still some lagging on the os.the whole experience like ur opening multiple layer of an app and when u switch them ur actually opening the apps again.on apple side apps are designed like they act like they are part of whole os and ur not actually switching apps,ur exploring the part of the whole os.another problem of s3 is display is over-saturated.it really give u misinterpret of a pic or app design pattern by over-saturated color,although movie watching is great.i really like about iPhone 5 is its a clean in design,display size and color accuracy .it  is good for mobile device which it should be.ios has a clean os interface although it has some limitation.if u want to customize ios get apps of ur desire which is key point of any os in market.with proper apps installed on ur ios device I think ios is more fast,fluid,polished,and great to work with everyday.</text>

    <text>I agree that iphone 5  is one of the best phones out there, but if we take the price point it's not worth it. Cause iphone 5 = 45000 INR (900$) we can get any android phone with same (or higher) features around 25000 to 40000 INR (500$ to 800$) so why spend more????????</text>

    <text>apple remains the best. Others may have too much of this, more of that but iphones are ideal and consistent in quality and user experience. So if u're looking to have a TV as mobile phone, why not hang ur LCD/plasma TVs on ur neck like Flavour Flav uses his wall clock. All I ask more of Apple is 'normal bluetooth sharing' of media items (images, audio, video), documents,...even if it just with apple devices, then file manager app, and also serve as a mobile memory drive that can access files and folders when plugged to any pc ....but that 's kinda asking too much.  thanks as we anticipate this in the next upgrade.

    <text>Iphone   5 is like a long awaited for iphone. Wow, I think apple shd stick to iphone, and stop making tablets, cos even this is somehow a let down (3 core gpu) instead of four. But its cool, just don't expect any creativity with it. Only. Gaming hahaha not as good as android powerfully awesome os,</text>

    <text>5 reasons why i choose andriods over iphones  1. there are more ways to customize your phone with andriod  2. all andriods built&amp;#65279; since 2012 have wayyy better processors then the iphone 5  3. WIDGETS!!!!!  4. in my opinion the iphone backrounds are ugly u just stare at ur apps....  5. androids are all diverse as to an iphone u get an iphone 4 or the same phone with an s put in to the name or a slightly better i phone 5.</text>

    <text>I really don't understand why you guys like to argue which is the best. Buying a smartphone is alike to choosing a partner. Everyone has different taste. End of the day what's most important is you like &quot;her&quot;. Who cares what other think. So be it Apple,Samsung,HTC,LG or Nokia they are just phones. Both my gf and i choose iphone5, for it's slim metallic design and retina display.We just love the display on iphone. Also the lightweight and small feel, that's our preference.</text>

It's using only dual core processor and 1GB ram but apps running with blazing speed,no laggy experience like cheap plasticy toy S3.it looks great in my hands.battery life is also great. I never wanna go for another android phone. Now, waiting for iphone 5s/6.maybe it comes with quad core, 2gb ram, great camera, 4.8 inch screen.hats off apple.(sorry for my bad english)</text>

    <text>the truth about the matter is, the hottest phine on the market is blackberry z10. basically all the apps on apple are there plus u can sideload android apps on the new blackberry. wat more can u ask for? plus it has a bigger screen that iphone 5 and the graphics are better. The front camera is better too with  2mp instead of 1.2mp. Also the RAM is 2gb while iphone 5 is 1gb RAM. ive used iphone 5 and the z10 and honestly the z10 is a better experience and is more use friendly</text>

    <text>If you want to buy a Baby Rattle Mobile its Okey.I have bought it December 2012 from the begging when i was just shake it i was hearing a click noice from the camera area i took it back to the carrier (Wind.gr)they kept it from February 2013 until 6 of March and they told me that all iphone5 have this noise by default. I contact Apple Support and i told them that Vodafone.gr and Cosmote.gr make replacement for this kind of problem.Still i am waiting for answer about my issue still i don't have my 740,00 euro phone. So my opinion before buying it open the box and shake it. After Sale Policy For I phone does not exist,and because i am telling the truth Apple Support Case Number: 421288645</text>

Surely the iphone is a premium phone but can't say that about the salesman today! I don't care how premium the product is and will not buy another product as I don't tolerate rudeness! Farewell Apple!</text>

    <text>if you want to have a hassle free phone, much more better to be with samsung or android phones. iphone's are anti piracy. and they secured every gadgets w/ itunes. w/c is for their business. most apps needs to be paid before you can download them w/c is unfair, because iphone is already expensive so why should their apps have some pricess as well. make no sense. they love money!</text>

    <text>Samsung make the Audio chip too,Sharp the screen and so on..Apple re-engineered that A6 chip with 1000 engineers they reckon to do what it does and with superb battery efficiency..  Apple only have to make one version of the App as such because they only have one device to make it for except screen size differences. Most apps are developed for IOS first because its easy to do with only one device but there is another reason and also why games go to IOS first but cant remember why..</text>

    <text>Bought an iPhone 5 32GB Black last week and it's cool! I cannot deny that Android is a very advance operating system but are all the devices optimized?  Don't be blinded by those quad-cores, octo-cores or anything because not all apps are capable of using all those cores. Some apps are just designed for dual-cores just like the iPhone 5.  Talking about apps, not all apps are suitable for a specific Android device because of all the varieties of Android devices in the market but in iPhone 5, all apps in the app store are all compatible though some of the apps are still in 640x960 but wait for few weeks they will already be 640x1136.  Android OS is a very nice OS indeed, in fact, I own an Android device.  Android is for those who are excited for full customization but iOS is for those who are just too lazy to customize. Android is advance and customer-tractable but how about bugs? Yes, you can get updates for your Android device but most of the time, they are getting released months after and still carrying bugs! And if you're going to buy an Android device, wait for 2-3 years and it's already stagnant compared to iPhones that can last up to 3-4 years.  If I have to decide between Operating Systems, I will choose both, because I am that kind of consumer who loves both! Sometimes I need Android and sometimes I need iOS.  If you think you need a fully-customizable OS that can allow you to download songs, videos, movies and 3rd party apps easily, GO FOR ANDROID!  If you think you need something simple that has less bugs and just sticks to the hand and you know for sure that you are financially capable in buying original songs and applications, go for iOS!  If you think you are financially upright, better buy both!</text>

    <text>Just switched across from Samsung S3 and so much better experience. With both Apple/Samsung/Blackberry it really is just a case of the users preferences. I prefer the ease of use of the iOS operating system. I've had no problems as yet with the &quot;paint&quot; on the phone coming off or scratching, battery life seems to be fine-with regular usage of apps and games etc i do have to charge once a day but its a smartphone, its what its there for! Truly brilliant experience overall-cannot find fault with it (yet!).</text>

    <text>As long as you keep away from that little spot ,all ok..If i put my finger across that gap the signal did drop..You can always put a piece of cellotape across it..It is the best your going to do for cheapest price to get an iphone..I found it just as fluid but the newer ones speed things up  a bit but it was still fluid.  Its up to you, S4 is a month off and if your just after iphone to put you on then  iphone 4 will give you near enuf same experiance as iphone 5 but no Siri.The biggest thing is how much you will lose in money if you buy one then sell it..If its not much then nothing to lose..I am UK and the iphone 4 still is expensive.</text>
