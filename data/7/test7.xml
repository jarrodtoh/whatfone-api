    <text>actually phablets like the note are very quickly taking over from iphone because with iphone you have to carry a phone and a tablet, but the last few years people in business are realising it's better to carry 1 device that can do everything they need.</text>

    <text>if you need an android and an ios device and you dont want to spend 1000 bucks i have an option for you! get an ipod touch 5g 16gb and a nexus 4 16gb both of them combined cost less then an iphone 5 but are much more useful!</text>

    <text>apple is total crap. even chinese xiaomi has a full hd phone or 1080pixels but iphone5 is only 640 pixels made by korean lg, china xiami sports quadcore cortex a15 but iphone only obsolete dual core cortex a5/6, xiaomi sports 2gb ram ddr3 but iphone only 512mb usable obsolete lpddr1 ram, xiaomi has 64 gb internal plus microsd card slot iphone has none, xiaomi is beautiful easy to use but iphone is not, xiaomi is premium chinese pride  but apple is built by foxconn china and the chinese from crap parts/materials. and xiaomi is china generic, but apple could not even come to one fourth its beauty poise quality. well china build the apple so you would expecg the apple would be decades inferior to the china phone. go china go japan go korea go india go vietnam, go go go.</text>

    <text>will iphone 5 be the smoothest phone for next 4 years?.. i mean i love iphones but now i kinda feel that why iphone 4 is not as smooth as it was when it came first? why it lags so much..afterall it is the same hardware to run ios as it came out with? is apple doing some into its updates to make old phones slower and to sell latest phones more.... i would love if some one using iphone discuss wuth me about this matter..thanks</text>
