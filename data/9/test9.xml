    <text>the main problem with dis fone or i must say with apple i phone is that you cannot download something other stuff from the fone browser...like song, video songs, hd videos, or any other application....like if u want to download opera or uc browser or any other messenger or any application from browser..you cannot  direct download from browser..this is the main drawback of this fone...the operating system of ios or windows fone are having the same problem..in this case android is the best option....android is better operating system than ios or windows.....</text>

    <text>its a good phone but now a days, iphone5 is no longer the best. it is now always left behind with new ideas. dual core while others are in quad.  if iphone 5s would be quad, other brand are in octa core. no new design since first gen. not even water, dust and shock proof like experia  no super zoom for cam like pureview. not even sexy like the supeslim design of other brands. please have a new technology ahead of other.</text>

    <text>after about 2months of use of iphone 5 , i think i can now give my verdict. i have been a nokia user all my life until now, i changed to apple because i wanted a secure operating system not easily prone to crashes and viruses, most of the nokia phones i used have at one time crashed even the one i used before the iphone 5 , the nokia e6. the iphone 5 is a very beautiful phone and really safe and works perfectly well especially the auto-correct keyboard which makes it work so well instead of making a larger screen iphone for a larger keyboard, so i advise apple to keep the restrictions on it because thats the reason why someone like me changed over to apple. i cant but comment on some draw backs though, the messaging is not well compartmentallised to sent,inbox,draft,received messages, delivery report and an extra folder to keep important messages like in my nokia e6,then i had to buy an application in app store to be able to send a contact card to people and even with that , i'm still unable to receive any contact card sent to the phone. i hope ios 7 will correct these issues. overall its the best phone out there and apple should keep the 4inch screen, anything bigger is probably not good. keep also the closed/restricted operating system as this protects the phone.</text>
