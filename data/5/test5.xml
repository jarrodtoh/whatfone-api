    <text>hello, i have some question to ask regarding the lte support on the iphone5. i bought an iphone5 from apple store in paris, but im currently living in malaysia, just a neighbouring country of singapore. the problem is that my lte isn't functioning..so my question is that, is there a possibility that my lte will not function because i bought it in paris and used it in malaysia, or is it my device is spoilt?</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is definitely an excellent phone, but the for ones whom like to 'personalize' and have fun with the system of their units it is certainly not preferable. so it's up to which side are you in. and despite the solid built, imho, it's too costly and lack of value.</text>

    <text>does anyone have this problem with an iphone 5? you are in the middle of a call and all of the sudden, the call fails, then the 'end call' hangs for a good two minutes before you can actually make another call.  02 blamed iphone and apple blamed 02. three sim cards and two phones later, there is no difference.</text>

    <text>i have been using iphone for the first time in my life for nearly a year now, used ltc before for a few years, it was boring, keep on hang. honestly my iphone 5 does not hang at all, that is suprisingly amazing to me, functions really well. i bought the black color one but no major scratch (yet, i am a careful user). the speed is superbly smooth going like a silk and i need to mention this again, it does not hang! i am really happy with that. i advise if u never use an iphone before and have been using other products, i can tell you that its well worth it, n i am a very satisfied customer. btw, it look stunning. enhances my good looks. haha</text>

    <text>i bought an iphone 5 last month i don't see anything impressive about the phone especially when you compare it with samsung galaxy s4,really s4 is giving it a hiding.first it doesn't memory card slot,no removable battery,even to put the sim card in the phone its a mission because u'll need the special tool to do that.to me only the looks of it is the that is attractive.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 has 2 disadvantages in my opinion: a)screen size, but you know that before you bought it. it has excellent performance on browsing but you cant enjoy at all because of the screen size. b)if you buy the black one as i do, use a case or every minute you will find new scratches on your phone coating. after some days of headache because of scratches i bought that flip case and now i am ok!  main advantages: quality, performance, ios 7.</text>

    <text>my unit has a defective screen,dead pixels with black tiny stripes that took more than 70% of the screen, purchased it only last july 2013 :(. i have never dropped the phone or placed it in a wet surface. been using it under normal condition. most of the time it stays in my bag since cellphones are not allowed inside my office. i thought this is the most durable phone today.</text>

    <text>i used to use a nokia 6700 and 6720 and was very happy with that compared to the iphone. nokia should have focused on these phones and the pricing. symbian was a good os. ms is going to kill nokia ! too bad. i still think my old nokia phones are much better than all this hype created by smart phones</text>
