    <text>hi, people out there. this is one of the best fone that i have used. to say, i am a real fan of good fones. the rest of the fones use quad core processor and stuff, but all that wont beat apple and its performance. this could be said as one of the best of its kind.</text>

    <text>hi everyone. i faced an awful issue about ios7. i checked my pancake like iphone5, fluent, with excellent camera and unbeatable video recording.  i lost my mind to apple's ads on ios7 and then upgrade to the wholly new os.  what happened next, since last week i lost many subjects thanks to the bad focus of my handset, my video recording in some occasion lost the colors which was unusual to me.  i checked this problem with a camera sensor tester, there was no problem at all.  if you want to buy this handset, before upgrade to ios7, first of all check all aspect of this phone on an already upgraded iphone5, if you satisfied then upgrade, if not, let the sleeping dogs lie.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is definetly not the best equipped phone in the world but god!!! that phone is second to none in terms of beauty and day to day performance , it's too beautiful and does whatever it does too well and it's just too simple to use. i started using iphones  after series of phones crashes with nokia, i joined the apple fans (i -sheep ) club mainly bcos of the closed ios , a little restriction i can live with if the price is to prevent virus invasion of the phone, i will definetly go back to my nokia if apple decides one day to make ios open source like android.</text>

    <text>i was very disappointed with this phone. unless you're able to handle as delicately as a thin piece of glass, it's not going to work out. i got a brand new one, and it's only been a month, and it will not charge at all. -_- it's been dead for a while. i can easily say that i've spent over a week, checking the inside for lint, switching chargers, the source which i charge from, even buying a new charger. from all i've tried, i can confirm that the phone is the problem, nothing else. now, i feel i've treated my phone quite delicately. i had a black otterbox case, and i have never gotten it wet i have taken off the case, and i have very few scratches. i was very excited to purchase a new iphone 5, but it shocked me to have</text>

    <text>the build quality of the two new apple iphones is lower than previous models, according to insurance company squaretrade.  squaretrade offers a gadget protection plan so it is jolly interested to know which phones it will have to pay out more to replace. americans have spent over $6 billion on broken iphones.  according to phys.org, while smartphones have tended to improve in durability, the iphone 5c and 5s are a step backwards and both received worse grades than the iphone 5.  squaretrade has put top-selling smartphones through a series of tests like dropping from five feet and submerging in water for 10 seconds.  eight different factors are used to calculate the phone's durability like materials used for the front and back, weight and size.  the phones are scored from one to ten, with a higher score meaning the phone is more likely to break.  last year, the iphone 5 had a score of five, but this year, the iphone 5s received a score of 5.5 and the iphone 5c received a score of 6.  the worst phone for durability was the samsung galaxy s4, which got a score of 7, while the best scoring phone was the google moto x with a score of 4.5.  ty shay, chief marketing officer at squaretrade had expected that at least one of the new iphone models would up its game, but it was the moto x that proved most forgiving of accidents.  it had been expected that the 5c would be less durable than the 5s because of its plastic case, but if you want an iphone to last it is probably better that you hang onto the iphone 5.</text>
