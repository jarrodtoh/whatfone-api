    <text>using this phone presently - great hardware but ios7 can be a pain sometimes. fonts are hard to read and most apps are not yet updated to the newest version. battery life on ip5 is average by best (i'm not a heavy user). specs wise iphones have started to lag behind their competition. i'm now eyeing moto x or blackberry z30, both have great battery life.</text>

    <text>the ios7 may be amazing with its quality and added functions. but the design isn't. the picture of the apps, is like a cartoon. more of a 2-dimensional,bright bold coloured, making the device look fake like a kids toy phone. all i am saying is the look of the apps is putting me off, definitely not buying the new iphone 5s or upgrading the ios7.</text>

    <text>i have upgraded my iphone 5 to ios7. ios7 screen has become very bright. we can't see clearly in lighting. for younger guys it may be ok but for elders it has become very very hard to read texts etc. not so good as ios6. ios6 look is very elegant n very much professional. ios7 is not as good as we thought it would be. very much disappointing in some ways. keyboard is not good like in ios6. the fonts became very thin n can't be seen clearly when typing texts. the new icons don't impress much as they are flat unlike in ios6. battery drains out very fast after upgrade. contact assigned photo gets blurred when we make a call. only incoming calls photo can be seen. this is ridiculous n i am not happy about that. i want to go back to ios6, i don't like the ios7. apple must to allow customers to downgrade to ios6 from ios7. because customers paid a lot of money so they have the right to opt whatever they like on their devices but should not be forced to use whatever the apple released. customers choice must be the final but not apple's choice. in such case apple customers will gradually opt for other platforms like android or windows or whatever they think they have more options .so apple should think of it and let the customers enjoy their choice, but not the mercy of apple. change should not be only for the sake of change it should satisfy the choice of customers, and it should make not only apple fanboys but also others attract and stay with apple. so please rethink of allowing to downgrade to ios6 from ios7 in order to satisfy its customers before they start replacing their mobiles with androids. or at least change the things what they want to bring the looks of ios6 with keyboard, fonts thickness, etc etc..  this is my opinion also and i agree with comment posted above by a user. i would also like to have my old look back other wise i have to sell this one and go for samsung. just bought this in january so i feel bad. plz let me know if i can get my old look back. i will also advice my friends to check before buying.</text>

    <text>hi everyone. i faced an awful issue about ios7. i checked my pancake like iphone5, fluent, with excellent camera and unbeatable video recording.  i lost my mind to apple's ads on ios7 and then upgrade to the wholly new os.  what happened next, since last week i lost many subjects thanks to the bad focus of my handset, my video recording in some occasion lost the colors which was unusual to me.  i checked this problem with a camera sensor tester, there was no problem at all.  if you want to buy this handset, before upgrade to ios7, first of all check all aspect of this phone on an already upgraded iphone5, if you satisfied then upgrade, if not, let the sleeping dogs lie.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is definetly not the best equipped phone in the world but god!!! that phone is second to none in terms of beauty and day to day performance , it's too beautiful and does whatever it does too well and it's just too simple to use. i started using iphones  after series of phones crashes with nokia, i joined the apple fans (i -sheep ) club mainly bcos of the closed ios , a little restriction i can live with if the price is to prevent virus invasion of the phone, i will definetly go back to my nokia if apple decides one day to make ios open source like android.</text>

    <text>i was very disappointed with this phone. unless you're able to handle as delicately as a thin piece of glass, it's not going to work out. i got a brand new one, and it's only been a month, and it will not charge at all. -_- it's been dead for a while. i can easily say that i've spent over a week, checking the inside for lint, switching chargers, the source which i charge from, even buying a new charger. from all i've tried, i can confirm that the phone is the problem, nothing else. now, i feel i've treated my phone quite delicately. i had a black otterbox case, and i have never gotten it wet i have taken off the case, and i have very few scratches. i was very excited to purchase a new iphone 5, but it shocked me to have</text>

    <text>the build quality of the two new apple iphones is lower than previous models, according to insurance company squaretrade.  squaretrade offers a gadget protection plan so it is jolly interested to know which phones it will have to pay out more to replace. americans have spent over $6 billion on broken iphones.  according to phys.org, while smartphones have tended to improve in durability, the iphone 5c and 5s are a step backwards and both received worse grades than the iphone 5.  squaretrade has put top-selling smartphones through a series of tests like dropping from five feet and submerging in water for 10 seconds.  eight different factors are used to calculate the phone's durability like materials used for the front and back, weight and size.  the phones are scored from one to ten, with a higher score meaning the phone is more likely to break.  last year, the iphone 5 had a score of five, but this year, the iphone 5s received a score of 5.5 and the iphone 5c received a score of 6.  the worst phone for durability was the samsung galaxy s4, which got a score of 7, while the best scoring phone was the google moto x with a score of 4.5.  ty shay, chief marketing officer at squaretrade had expected that at least one of the new iphone models would up its game, but it was the moto x that proved most forgiving of accidents.  it had been expected that the 5c would be less durable than the 5s because of its plastic case, but if you want an iphone to last it is probably better that you hang onto the iphone 5.</text>

    <text>was torn between jumping from android to iphone as i do love my sony's but having played with my wife's 4s with the new updated 7.0 i was won over. i went for the iphone 5 as the 5s was just too much money and the 5c felt cheap and after comparing the 5 to the 5c it was a no brainer the 5c just isnt worth anything considering its newer than the 5. after a few weeks of playing with my 5 i must say im impressed with its user friendlyness even more so than the old android jellybean its just plain nicer to look at lol i have filled it up with all my old music (after putting it on itunes) the camera is far better than my old sony xperia s in terms of quality which i foun strange considering the sony was 12mp and the 5 is only 8mp, and i find i have better signals from my provider which is still o2. over all i would say to anyone looking at iphones if you cant afford the 5s then do yourself a favour and get the iphone 5 not the 5c its the same phone only better built :)</text>

    <text>i too have a iphone 4s and have been using it for more than a year. but since i upgraded to ios7 i am facing lots of problem (battery, auto mute while talking, worst appearance etc.,).  1. the developers should re think on bringing the older look which is very professional including the search option. 2. fix the battery, keypad bug.  as soon as possible.</text>

    <text>i cannot believe that apple advertise the iphone 5 with a 8mp camera it should be more like a 2mp camera. the quality is extremely poor and i am very dissipointed. when someone spend the amount of money what apple users are currently spending then you would like to have a top class quality phone with amazing features. i am very dissipointed with apple and i will prefer to rather go back to my blackberry. the camera is only one feature that i am mentioning but there are a lot more that dissipointed me and if i can make my dicision all over again then i would and apple will definitly not be on my shopping list.</text>

    <text>hello, i have some question to ask regarding the lte support on the iphone5. i bought an iphone5 from apple store in paris, but im currently living in malaysia, just a neighbouring country of singapore. the problem is that my lte isn't functioning..so my question is that, is there a possibility that my lte will not function because i bought it in paris and used it in malaysia, or is it my device is spoilt?</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is definitely an excellent phone, but the for ones whom like to 'personalize' and have fun with the system of their units it is certainly not preferable. so it's up to which side are you in. and despite the solid built, imho, it's too costly and lack of value.</text>

    <text>i have been using iphone for the first time in my life for nearly a year now, used ltc before for a few years, it was boring, keep on hang. honestly my iphone 5 does not hang at all, that is suprisingly amazing to me, functions really well. i bought the black color one but no major scratch (yet, i am a careful user). the speed is superbly smooth going like a silk and i need to mention this again, it does not hang! i am really happy with that. i advise if u never use an iphone before and have been using other products, i can tell you that its well worth it, n i am a very satisfied customer. btw, it look stunning. enhances my good looks. haha</text>

    <text>i bought an iphone 5 last month i don't see anything impressive about the phone especially when you compare it with samsung galaxy s4,really s4 is giving it a hiding.first it doesn't memory card slot,no removable battery,even to put the sim card in the phone its a mission because u'll need the special tool to do that.to me only the looks of it is the that is attractive.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 has 2 disadvantages in my opinion: a)screen size, but you know that before you bought it. it has excellent performance on browsing but you cant enjoy at all because of the screen size. b)if you buy the black one as i do, use a case or every minute you will find new scratches on your phone coating. after some days of headache because of scratches i bought that flip case and now i am ok!  main advantages: quality, performance, ios 7.</text>

    <text>i have no allegiance to any vendor but here's some stuff for you:  at work and in personal life heres some recent iphone 5 stats:  2 people at work (their personal phones) 5 swap outs between them - in the last 6 months:  1 person at work (work phone)about to have a swap out (5 days)  family members new iphone about to be swapped out (6 days).  devices are about choice and preference for some and fashion statements for others.  once thing that is clearly obvious, those that made choice can't seem to handle the fact the object of their desire isn't as great as they hoped it would be.</text>

    <text>8 cores actually do make a difference because it uses 4 a15 cores for most things and an extra 4 a6 cores to save power because when you not using the phone it switches to the low-power cores or if you just doing something simple like listening to music it can help save the battery a lot. and you obviously have no idea how ram works if you think 3gb is too much because it means the note 3 can handle things like 4k videos, do more things at once and the phone doesn't have to keep closing tasks so everything opens quicker.</text>

    <text>no matter what materials you use big phones are always easier to break than things like the little tiny iphone, because even phones a quarter of the price of iphone with the same little 3.5&quot;-4&quot; screens are almost as strong and reliable, so all apple does is give expensive materials because it makes people who don't know any better think that it makes a better phone when it's actually just for show to give people something to brag about.</text>

    <text>i'm not saying maybe businessmen are using phablets i'm telling you for a fact that it is very increasingly happening, because i'm guessing you've barely ever touched an android device because the fact is they can do 80% of what a laptop can do and businessmen who aren't stuck in an office all day are seeing the benefit of a phablet that is small enough to fit in your pocket but big enough to comfortably see the screen.</text>

    <text>it's not better but there was an expectation.  this means, that people thought they wuold get better o/s, redesidned look and feel to the phone.  there was nothing really new introduced to the phone which is why the market does not think it's better, and that is why you see the lower rating.  personally i use iphone and galaxy phones but on my personal phone i switched to galaxy when the s2 came out.  there was no comparing, iphone is miles behind.</text>

    <text>iphone has less features than android but enough. but some features of todays phones are required.it run better and faster than android in less ram and smaller processor. the problem is stupid restrictions like that prison itunes. irritates too much. and that theme on ios 7 is very ugly. i think 5s wont be good and not much new but make 6 innovative and give freedom. please dont follow &quot;make everything large&quot; like sheep. not large than 4.3&quot;. make iphablets for those who are asking for large screen</text>

    <text>taking over? haha. c'mon business men have laptops. you can see a few with tablets but. mostly kids have tablets for gaming. smoothness reliability durability and accuracy are just one of the few reasons why people still choose iphone. can't argue with that.</text>

    <text>hi guys, i bought my i phone 5 just 3 months ago, one day it has given me battery error (as it looks like almost finished and after an hour it shows me full) and from last few days i am getting problem with its mouse which start and stop working automatically without any intimation, i purchased this from dg sharaf (muscat) and the time when i have contacted them they didnt give me good response as they said that i have to leave my phone with them and they will take 10 to 15 days to check and resolve this issue. as per my opinion this apple items are just costly but not durable and reliable. if anyone wants, i can show my invoice and i can provide my contact details for to give you justification on this product.</text>

    <text>the way you put it in that context saying android is for geeks ect is false really, as nearly all apple products are more expensive, classed as a more luuxury phone really, also the iphone battery is absolutly apauling compared to some of the galaxys, especially the s4, one of my friends has an s4 and doesnt need to charge it for what like 2 days and uses it a lot, where as my iphone 5 needs charging withing like 14 hours or less!</text>

    <text>1. more battery efficient. 2. more control over application lifecycle. 3. one quick glance in one page, you can see all notifications/date/time/badges/status of network/bt/batterylife etc. 4. no rouge application, all are tested to work and will not run in infinite loop and drain battery. 5. itunes/icloud sync. your iphone 3gs can live on with iphone 5. everything including social / games / webbrowsing / etc can be transferred over and it works. (compared to rooted android's titanium backup)  put it simply, ios is for people who want a working mobile and concentrate on real life, while android is for tweaks and geeks who have too much time on hand and spend it all on their mobile.</text>

    <text>after about 2months of use of iphone 5 , i think i can now give my verdict. i have been a nokia user all my life until now, i changed to apple because i wanted a secure operating system not easily prone to crashes and viruses, most of the nokia phones i used have at one time crashed even the one i used before the iphone 5 , the nokia e6. the iphone 5 is a very beautiful phone and really safe and works perfectly well especially the auto-correct keyboard which makes it work so well instead of making a larger screen iphone for a larger keyboard, so i advise apple to keep the restrictions on it because thats the reason why someone like me changed over to apple. i cant but comment on some draw backs though, the messaging is not well compartmentallised to sent,inbox,draft,received messages, delivery report and an extra folder to keep important messages like in my nokia e6,then i had to buy an application in app store to be able to send a contact card to people and even with that , i'm still unable to receive any contact card sent to the phone. i hope ios 7 will correct these issues. overall its the best phone out there and apple should keep the 4inch screen, anything bigger is probably not good. keep also the closed/restricted operating system as this protects the phone.</text>

    <text>bro, if you buy iphone u need a pc to take backup or restore, i cloud can help to an extent but u will need a pc for restoring or if you phone goes in recovery mode. maybe developed country or not we need more at least 2 sim's for office and personal purpose.  maybe people from a developed country can understand it.</text>

    <text>apple please remove your restrictions and youll reach very high. you dont even need more features(though add some new features in next ios please.) your perormance and stability is enough reason for people to buy ios devices. i used. 4s and s3(both not latest but good enough) and 4s performs better even s3 has more features. do it soon before android becomes stable please</text>

    <text>something i would also like to share. google play doesn't support much of the apps you use like whatsapp, viber, subway surfers (game) in countries in south america whereas apple itunessupports any app no matter where you are. although you have to pay for some apps but using it on ios is better than downloading it on android. so people the best is to go for iphone cause any apple product has the best performance over all. so stop hesitating between s3 and s4 and go for iphone 5 :)</text>

    <text>10 good reasons to jailbreak your iphone, no matter what generation . . . i guess theres a large number of iphone owners that are still hesitant to jailbreak their iphones. they consider jailbreaking a dangerous and daunting task that may eventually void their warranty. since im on the other side of that barricade, ive put down a nice list of the 10 new features you will get if you go for jailbreaking. the benefits are more than ten, but ive compiled the most major ones.  jailbreaking is a software process that unlocks the access to the iphone original system files so that you can modify some of them for the better. you shouldnt confuse it with a carrier unlock. jailbreaking allows us to unleash the true power of the apples iphone.  getting your iphone jailbroken is like getting a totally different device  at least software-wise. and while i find it next to impossible to resist the tempting new features, i can totally understand you may have perfectly good reasons to keep your iphone untouched. but hopefully, this list will help you convert.  and a word of warning! this post is not a tutorial in jailbreaking your iphone. if you need one, a nice place to start is iclarified iphone section. installing unofficial third-party apps may cause unwanted side effects so always rely on your good judgment when dealing with those. i am not to be held responsible for any damage you may inflict to your iphone.  1. multitasking  the first new benefit from jailbreaking is surely true multitasking. there is a free and a paid app that both offer task switching and management each in its own way. both depend on a third-party app  the free backgrounder  to do the minimizing for them. while that may sound complex, switching apps is as easy as it gets.  the free task manager is called kirikae and shows the running apps as a list. tapping one will switch to it, while a finger swipe reveals a button to kill the process.  multifl0w is the paid task manager. it offers the same functionality as kirikae, but uses a cover-flow-like view for your running apps. its kinda like the way safari displays the opened tabs. multifl0w looks really fancy and even outperforms palm pres card interface at times.  lockscreen applications  thanks to the several available lockscreen applications like lockinfo and intelliscreen, you can get acess to your calls, messages, calendar events, weather information, etc. straight from the iphone lockscreen.  improved messaging  the devil is in the details, they say the iphone is skimpy on a lot of them details. delivery reports and a sms character counter are certainly two of those.  with the help of the sms helper app you get a nicely integrated character counter, which looks as if apple made it themselves.  need delivery reports? the iphonedelivery is a simple, but highly useful app thats capable of *delivering* you delivery reports in various customizable ways.  make ringtones out of your music without itunes  the iphone ringtone limitations are quite a bugger. the anyring app will set your incoming calls music free of apple.  you can choose any song from your ipod library, trim it and assign it as a ringtone or alarm tone. the downside is that you have to pay for anyring itself (yes, the most innovative unofficial apps are paid).  6. video recording on iphone 2g and 3g  you dont have to own an iphone 3gs to shoot video. thanks to the cycorder app you can capture videos at cif resolution at 15fps, which is way better than that joke of a video recorder in the official appstore.  7. file access and management  after you jailbreak your iphone, you have full access to the file system. the ifile app is a popular file manager running directly on your iphone. it is capable of copying, cutting, moving, renaming and deleting files.  8. safari file download manager  if youve missed having a way to download files on the iphone, you may be interested in the safari download plug-in. its basically a download manager for the mobile safari browser. however you will need a file manager to access the files once theyre downloaded.  9. extended tv-out functionality  if you are tired of the tv-out restrictions in your iphone, youre in for a nice surprise once you jailbreak your iphone. the tvout app is here to help. it enables the tv-out output for all iphone applications. it has some problems with the landscape apps, but theres another application called landscape tv out that fixes that as well. now imagine playing your iphone games on a big tv screen.  10. misc ui improvements  as i mentioned in the beginning of the article, there are a lot of other benefits from jailbreaking. though none of them is a major thing, i appreciate every single one.  if you happen to own an iphone 2g or 3g you will most definitely welcome the battery percentage level (3gs-style) that can be enabled via the asbattery app.  perhaps all iphone users will appreciate the hapticpro app, which enables vibration touch feedback. the sbsettings app is practical as well. it gives you quick access to various features and its always a single swipe away  some of the functionality it offers is a basic task manager, 3g, wi-fi and edge switches, respring shortcuts and even more</text>

    <text>according to apple,  any display with high resolution means any display with more than 300 ppi is called retina display. based on this, retina is just a trademark  taken by apple. so retina means nothing new it has, it is just a display having more than 300 ppi resolution fore mobile phone and more than 220 ppi for tablet.</text>

    <text>apple products are the best to use and simple! currently using itouch 5 and it is very much similar to iphone 5.i have planned to buy iphone 5 in coming december...will be using both. once an apple user always an apple user. i have used sony ericsson,nokia,samsung and currently using blackberry 8520...bb is just for calls and sms but all other apps on my itouch 5 you can like and love apple but cannot hate it after using it for a week as it is so much user friendly...apple's each product is worth using...though it is expensive but once you get used to it,it is the best that suits you...apple products have their own class</text>

    <text>what for to have a very big screen if it's always lagging like [not to mention of the name]..like some of the products especially on smartphones, every of their new products when coming out, there will going to be a little bit bigger in size of the screen than the previous one...what for when it is unfit in your pocket and probably it will going to be uncomfortable + very very weird to carry your smartphone around right?..moreover, samsung also is a fraud as they like to copy others in their production..for me, smartphone with enough functionality and comfortablity is the main aspects that we need to think about when we going to buy them..so, think twice when you gonna buy them..don't just judge the books by its cover...:)</text>

    <text>i know iphone is good phone but problem is it is not with time. old features,  old look, small display,  no ota installation support,  no usb otg, no mhl, no infrared,  no nfc, mapapp is no good, and if we don't have jailbreak ios on it than it is really hell, u always need pc for apps installation,  less ppi. i will wait for iphone 6 and check what it will provide to us. but by the time,  android phone will more and more...</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is such a great product i've ever used. but just recently i've sold my iphone 5 and bought the galaxy s3.  u wanna know why??? its not because the iphone. ios is the reason why i've sold the iphone. i need an open source!!! since the 6.1.4 upgrade,my iphone becomes useless!!! no more jailbreak. now im happy with my s3. yes it does lag. but not too much. at least now i can enjoy my phone. without rooting im also can download anything from the web,install cracked apps,share things with my friends,native video calling etc. iphones is a  great device. but the ios restriction will make u think twice. no doubt ios is the simple user friendly os. it ls fast,stable, well optimized and have a ton of good quality apps. but without jailbreak, all the idevice is useless!!! trust me. im an ios user since the 3gs. it is better on the outside. not in the inside. apple does not really care about what peoples need. the only care about their business. by making all the restriction they can generate a ton of profit!!!! itunes is sucks!!! apple also sucks!!!! but not the iphones. iphones is the great quality device.</text>

    <text>apple is useless in phone making process.the new iphone 5 is so useless.i have this during 6 months ago and doesn't support anything. main disadvantages   aluminum body looks cool but is easy to scratch proprietary connector, incompatible with previous-gen accessories (needs adapter) the new display is not proportionally bigger, but only taller unadapted apps run letterboxed due to the unusual resolution nano-sim support only apple maps app not up to scratch no usb mass storage mode no fm radio no stereo speakers no microsd card slot no nfc connectivity (though that may be nitpicking) stuck with itunes for loading content mono audio recording in videos   and other things like the user interface which so simple.and the camera contains only hdr,panoroma and normal capturing.which i hate so much.  after i didn't like it and selled it.now i have htc one v 'the best phone'.contains every feature in phone and in its andriod market.i am so happy with htc.never buying useless apple again.  go,for htc</text>

    <text>have been using an iphone 5 for about 9 months &amp; am very happy, even though it does not have the specs of the s4, the phone is quick, really quick, no lag, no crashing, the phone has worked perfectly. i don't see why you would want to make it any quicker, it has creamed everything i have thrown at it, hd movies etc, i have seen a s4 in action &amp; would have to say the iphone 5 is only a tiny bit behind the s4 in performance, but with no heavy battery drain &amp; no temp problems. money well spent, my 2 cents worth.</text>

    <text>i got iphone 5 64 gb around 2 months back. it is awesome. absolutely addictive. android users can never feel what is the meaning of net surfing, gaming, listening to music, etc till they put their hands on an ios device. the fluid operations of the ios just make life extremely easy. pages is the app equivalent to ms word on ios or mac, keynote is powerpoint of apple and numbers is excel of apple. these apps are all as useful on the mobile devices as on a mac. i had used android devices and purchased so many office apps on google play.... but was relieved only after getting the work app pack on ios on my iphone 5 and ipad3 with retina display. the display is extremely beautiful and it is absolutely impossible to take your eyes off ..... you just get stuck to it. gaming experience as well. no lag, no drag, no crash.... a bit of heat is experienced when too much gaming is done. battery life is gorgeous with wifi. continuous chatting on 3 g gives close to 8 hours of life. facebook chat consumes a lot of battery. whatsapp or imessage ( free chat iphone to iphone ) .. actually imessage is free chat on ios to ios devices... ipod touch/ iphone / ipad... if you have the money... just get it... also see to it that you have a nice collection of cases as it is delicate on the edges... extremely beautiful.. best friend... has replaced my laptop more than 80%... mail checking is nice... google search is awesome... siri is cute. does everything for you from making a call to putting a status on facebook! come out of android... get an iphone 5,</text>

    <text>android is junk and highly unoptimized.  android users are already unsure about s4 pro running 1080p (a awesome quad core) (xperia z / tablet)  they need s600 / s800 before they can be secure.  plain specs followers.  ipad 3 only have dual core.. and it can support greater then 1080p screen!! and its smooth and fast.  this prove that ios is very optimized and no need for those high end chip/battery to be usable.  buy a recent iphone, and you can be sure you get good performance for at least 2 years and os update for 3 years.</text>

    <text>i phone is whack. i can not use a phone that has specs lower that of the samsung galaxy note2...... apple is still behind the size is poor the camera is un impresive the specs worse plus the apps all too costly and not user friendly the idea of having to jail break the phone to get stuff is all too whack get the samsung galaxy s3 note2or the samsung s4 and you will finally see the light</text>

    <text>they may bash apple a countless times, but i can faily say that this phone is still a miles better if you are after a flawless running software.  i've been an on and off android user, but in the end i always go back to apple as i get easily annoyed with lagging and app crashing issues.  you might have had a phone with amazing apps with open ware capabilities like android, but it would be useless if it still gives you an underwhelming hands on experience (hanging, crashing, etc).</text>

    <text>hey friends........let me give a true idea to you....  iphone 5 is not a good option according to me.it has good build quality but has low specs and high price.i took iphone 5 in my hand and i checked it.to be honest, it is not worth it....if it was for 400 usd without contact, it would be great but it is a waste of money at this price...  better go for something else.please note that it is not worth it.....</text>

    <text>so true! that's exactly the same way i think about the differences between ios and android, i have an android, and its hard to find any good apps for free. and most of the &quot;free&quot; apps give me spam ads, even in the notification bar! i also have and ipod4, and i'm always able to find good apps for free. for example, on android, there aren't apps for tv services like travelchannel, a&amp;e, cbs, and disney. while on ios, you can find them all and stream very nicely, without a boatload of ads. this very big difference in app availability is pushing me to switch to an iphone.</text>

    <text>most preferred phone in the world for the common people because of the app store.  99% you are using applications, and a phone is only as good as it can run the applications smoothly and save battery when not in use.  android lacks a good app store, and its dangerous as well.. install wrongly there goes your phone.  if you want to enjoy media/play games/smooth webbrowsing get this phone.</text>

    <text>the iphone 5 is a beautiful, well-crafted smartphone. but at the same time, its lightweight aluminum body may easily bend or scratch if the handset is not handled with care. that explains why there's plenty of protective iphone 5 cases on the market, ranging from the sleek and barely noticeable, to the tough and extremely durable.</text>

    <text>i have been using apple iphone5 for a year now, and this post will give you a brief idea about how iphone5 works after a year. firstly pros: no lags, not even a single lag. i think iphone5 has been superior among gaming and the graphics are good.  screen is highly responsive quick smooth and rugged.  the phone has been outstanding in durability. its one of the best phones including motorola defy plus and sony active when it comes to durability. with no scratch n a minor dent. the metal framing is tricky but a good cover or bumper can save it.  the phone accessories are still working in the best conditions.  cons: the phone lock/unlock button has become loose and needs a harder press.  the microphone for phone calls is not that loud. and connectivity is an issue sometimes with 3g also.  rest the phone is in its best shape may be minor problems but iphone5 still stands 1st rank with the new ios7 and better processor</text>

    <text>the specs speak for themselves. s4 beats iphone5 in every spec:  - iphone 5 still using 1.3 ghz dual-core processor? come on. s4 has 2 quad-core processors (1.6 ghz for intensive processing, and 1.2 ghz for saving battery when not intensive).  - s4 has twice the ram.  - s4 display has a higher resolution (~441 ppi vs 326 ppi)  - s4 has 13mp camera, iphone 5 has 8mp camera.  - s4 has the android stock browser and chrome browser, much better than safari.  - s4 has android, a superior operating system that is open, allows java and flash to run, and gives you access to many free services that you need to pay for if you use ios.  samsung galaxy s4 beats iphone5 hands down.</text>

    <text>tcool was paid by samsung just to criticized iphone because they envied iphone. if you tcool think that apple's ios has been hacked, think twice. your plasticky samsung powered by google has been more vulnerable to hacked than the genuine iphone. think about it.</text>

    <text>if you're fun of surfing you're definitely wrong on choosing iphone5. iphone 5 has the overheating problem when using data network. it gets hot even if you use data on a short period of time. battery life is also a problem. you can actually charge the phone two times a day. but resolution is good but totally iphone 4s is much better than iphone5.</text>

    <text>i have an iphone 5 32gb . i recommend it to those people who keep asking on what phone to buy. ipone 5 is the best . you can just put it in your pocket easily, long life battery, camera i'll rate it 5 . everything apple did in this phone is perfect . no other phone can match iphone5. so stop those annoying questions just go buy iphone5. :)</text>

    <text>hope there is also waterproof smart watch camera phone from apple like what lg did last 2010. sony made a bluetooth watch where you need your real smart phone within your range but its not as good as what lg did where you can insert a different sim card to ensure to receive all important calls and messages as well as instantly sending messages and making calls. its a very useful device for active people who spend their day most on sports like swimming running dancing and other physical activities which i do not understand why only less cellphone manufacturers follow lg with this concept.</text>

    <text>personally i would not purchase an iphone because i cannot justify spending the money on one. that does not mean that the product sucks, it is all about personal preference. i have an ipod which is no iphone, but i can understand why iphone users love their iphones. yes they are using similar features as previous iphones, but why change the design or the interface if it works well as it is. sometimes changing things does not always work well. hats of to apple for making something people love, and for making other companies to step up in their game.</text>

    <text>iphone might have bad specs to most giant phones. but its collection of apps is what makes it worth while!  s4 might have good hardware.. the apps on the play store are junk!  games/social/web/video/music still iphones best. (not just iphone5)  stick with android you will forever be upgrading and tweaking to no end!.. draining your battery and life together!</text>

    <text>on a side note, i couldnt help but notice that apples new iphone iteration due for an autumn release features something very similar to jollas ambience function  coincidence, i think not. in ios7, it appears that by changing the wallpaper on the homescreen, you also change the look and feel of the phone which seems (like the ambience feature in sailfish) to reflect the colours in your wallpaper image.  a lot of the other features in ios7 seem to have been heavily influenced by meego, web os and many other operating systems. there go apple again taking from others and calling it their own!  so lets support the real innovators and help get jolla up there with the big boys!  sail on</text>

    <text>apple always have 1 app that requires you to upgrade to the next iphone,,for example iphone 4s had siri which would not run on 4..they have to sell phones like anyone else and that special app helps folk who would otherwise just upgrade to next version of ios upgrade to new iphone model alongside contract renewals and fans.</text>

    <text>no matter what happen. this phone will be the best of all elite phones.no one can destroy the reputation of apple. esp. iphone. after several years from now. it will still be the most talked about mobile in the world because of its premium product. and other brands will be talked about on how they try to deminish iphone. no wonder why apple dont give such ammount of effort to compete with other brands. they are too strong enough to be destroyed. what more if apple will release some products that can rival samsungs gimmiky features. alot of people will still choose apple after they have tried other brands. you just cant kill them. iphone will be iphone and other phone brands will be just phones. long live apple.</text>

    <text>at first i bought ip5 - my first (and only) apple/smartphone device - then i read most of your comments. i have to admit i was terrified that i made the worst choice ever, after i read about all the potential faults of this phone. i even left the phone in the box for a week without opening it (pls, don't laugh at me). finally, i started using it. it is just great. my device doesn't have any defect, my sister's neither. i am very happy with it. if only it had a fm radio (tiresome request, i know). but still it is the best user experience ever.</text>

    <text>hi guys...as u heard many times apple or samsung,or i5 or s4, i used both,but if u wants pure quality,realibily, smooth touch, nice headphone output,weightless, and very good resale value go for i5 without any hasitetion..and if u wants.. big screen, expandable memory, replacable battery, then only go for s4.. my choice is iphone 5... true smart phone is apple i5..</text>

    <text>it really depends on what you want. if you want the best apps (free and paid) with very little lag and a great overall camera then iphone 5 is for you. if you want a iphone lookalike with great customization options and most great apps with a great low-light camera with front speakers then htc one is for you.</text>

    <text>to those who are planning to get this phone, guys galaxy s4 is much better than iphone 5. try to review their specs. you can see that s4 has much more to offer for your lifestyle and entertainment interest.  s4 is  better: quadcore cpu larger screen size greater graphic capability better camera than i5  ty to review their specs. iphone has become popular because of jobs. but now? god.. try to look at the ios 7 which is the latest ios, it looks like android of something like picassa theme.. steve job's unique style is missing.. just a comment..</text>

    <text>u will never know about iphone until u use it !  i was no fan of iphone, its a very expensive and with limited connectivity and file management system. i thought it a shit !  but now i use iphone 5 and i decided hear after i will only use  iphone ! its the best !  i have used blackberry, android (samsung, sony, htc), windows, linux so on.... and i never get the performance of iphone in any other phone.  i agree samsung s4 have very hi hardware configuration, but the performance is poor...! cannot even compare with iphone.  the smart phone should be smart, not very huge with 5 inch screen.....  iphone is handy, smart, tough, and only this i want more is water/dust proof, maybe in next generation we will get it.....  iphone fans cheer . . . .!</text>

    <text>i am extremely disappointed in ios 7. like always, it just copies features from android, gives them a new name and calls them innovations... i mean come on! what's revolutionary about auto-updates, unified browser bar and the innovative control center??? at least stop suing the brands you steal from, show a little class...</text>

    <text>how much of an iphone is made by samsung?  apple doesn't make the iphone itself. it neither manufactures the components nor assembles them into a finished product. the components come from a variety of suppliers and the assembly is done by foxconn, a taiwanese firm, at its plant in shenzhen, china. the teardown graphic below, based on data from isuppli, a market-research firm, shows who makes what inside the iphone, and how much the various bits cost. samsung turns out to be a particularly important supplier. it provides some of the phone's most important components: the flash memory that holds the phone's apps, music and operating software; the working memory, or dram; and the applications processor that makes the whole thing work. together these account for 26% of the component cost of an iphone.  this puts samsung in the somewhat unusual position of supplying a significant proportion of one of its main rival's products, since samsung also makes smartphones and tablet computers of its own. apple is one of samsung's largest customers, and samsung is one of apple's biggest suppliers. this is actually part of samsung's business model: acting as a supplier of components for others gives it the scale to produce its own products more cheaply. for its part, apple is happy to let other firms handle component production and assembly, because that leaves it free to concentrate on its strengths: designing elegant, easy-to-use combinations of hardware, software and services.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 has 1gb of ram and galaxy s4 has 2gb. but when you run and open apps/games,they both have the same speed! even if the iphone 5 has lower specs. ios is still the best when it comes to processing speed. android have lags but in ios i dont feel a thing.iphone 5 benchmark rating is good,but the s4 is the best. and s4 wins when it comes to features but i dont actually use them that much. s4 has a larger screen which is not that portable compare to iphone 5. i5 fits in my pocket and i like it, but s4? too wide for my pocket. iphone 5 and ios is simply amazing. great phone when it comes to speed and portability.</text>

    <text>apple is for classes not for masses. don't compare ios with android. if apple wants they can release low-cost iphone long time ago. apart from google nexus no android phone is smooth or out of lag. even galaxy s4 also lags. and also all other android phone apart from nexus comes with lot of bloat ware. now a days microsoft/nokia devices are good and out of lag. but long way to go. on june 29, 2007, apple released the first version of what became ios  concurrently with the first iphone. android 1.0, the first commercial version of the software, was released on 23 september 2008, approx 13 months later than ios. so please guys don't compare android with ios.</text>

    <text>haha, android is the best, all of us know after the jelly bean the android got much faster and smoother, yes the old android phone do lag, but check out the new ones, they are lag free, and android is fully customizable, not only talking about the ui, the whole os!, and of course the updates will get the updates asap, hah, how many devices use ios anyway? and also you can find jelly bean for almost any android phone on xda so no need for official update anyway, iphone is much more expensive and is very strict, i like how it is fast and smooth but.... android is still the king.</text>

    <text>used almost all famous android phones(galaxy s 1,2,3,4, htc desire s, one x, one s, desire hd, sony xperia u, s and all ios phones except iphone 3gs..  here in pakistan u can have a unlocked phone, use it for a while and then u can sell it in market in a good price and opt for other one... so i used these all phones in this context..  my experience about android is (1) it is heavy os, consumes more ram, and storage + battery to provide u adequate experience e.g in( games, and daily ui interaction)(laggy thoug)  recently bought galaxy s4 = lags like hell&gt; camera app most of the time restarted the phone and gaming experiencing still not par with ios even after having octa core processor and yet so fragile phone, i dropped my mine from my back pocket on the road and almost all the frame aside of screen got dents and bruises and saw many shattered s4's screens in market already so i sold it( remember i bought it after selling my iphone 5)   iphone 5= u will not believe it i bought it 2 times and sold it to enjoy the android experience but at the end  i always come to the point the in daily routine droid phones sucks crashes all the time so now i m again about to buy an apple device becoz of its stability and class.  iphone does all my daily needs with ease e.g phone app is much more faster to open in ios than in android same to the other apps e.g mssgng.. battery is cool and standby time of iphone 5 is no match to the droids ..its amazing  i am waiting to buy new iphone or iphone 5 in september ....ios 7= cool</text>

    <text>in an effort to be more transparent, apple has released for the first time specific information about its final assembly facilities.  while apple published a list of its supply makers last year, the new information gives more details about where each apple product is made. the tech giant named the 17 factories where its products are assembled and packaged and also named which product is assembled at each facility and where that facility is located. all but one of the suppliers is owned by a taiwanese company, and 14 of the 17 factories are located in china.  (read more: foxconn challenged as global reach grows )  apple also revealed that the taiwanese company hon hai precision industrycommonly known as foxconnowns assembly plants for iphones and ipads. (read more: in asia's trend-setting cities, iphone fatigue sets in )  criticism of working conditions at hon hai has put pressure on apple to increase transparency about where its products are made.  (read more: apple supplier foxconn shares hit after factory brawl )  (read more: foxconn admits employing 14-year-old interns )  there is one assembly plant located in the u.s., which is owned by the taiwanese company quanta computer, that assembles mac computers.</text>

    <text>it was a blow to realize that the iphone 5 i bought last week did not have 16x9 aspect ratio for photos to go with the wide screen on the phone.  virtually everything today is going wide screen, even the video camera in the iphone. right now i'd like to go back to my iphone 4 and carry my canon, but that phone is gone and i'm stuck with a phone with photos sized for old monitors and crt tvs. i'm not happy with apple's lagging on this.</text>

    <text>based on my experience...iphone is the best for me! have switched to s3 from ip4s and then to ip5...then just recently to s4 i9505 lte, barely 2 weeks and i am back to ip5...the feel,the touch, the look, the durability and most importantly the use...it is definitely ip5...no question  to some it may be otherwise, but speaking for myself...it is the best in the market, truly a class above the rest ip5 is a phone and the extras it carries with it are just bonuses....if you need a high megapixel camera go buy a camera, a gaming station get one and not a phone....high speed internet get a laptop...and so forth and so on if you are an android fan...then you are not supposed to be here...</text>

    <text>hi guys all you are talking about quad core,ram &amp; size of the screen.thats not the things you have to check about.you have to see whether it works to its specs.thats where we come to apple iphones.in previous models they have been giving 800mhz processor &amp; 256 ram but the things is it wont get slow even if apps runs in background.i tested that with more than 20 apps running in the background.still its fast.you have to understand its about their ios software.and most of you guys know that for movie editing apple pc is only used. cause its about the pixel depth.no screen can compare to those apple products.there screen is the main thing thats y they have given the retina display which no one else has given in phones. and the graphics its always outstanding they are using triple core graphics.and for battery try and see it.you guys itself knows some technical details about battery.what about the apples r&amp;d department? think.the battery may be 1440 mah.there software dosent use up all the battery resources.in android you are using battery saver or some apps.but they are in built thats y i am saying try and see it guys.apple iphone is not like any other products.they are not releasing every month a model.they dedicate they lifes to create the best one even if it takes a year or five.they try to give  the best guys.the only thing that truly lacks is bluetooth it can only send from apple to apple.other than that.its the best.</text>

    <text>who cares about technical specification if the phone runs smooth? the difference performance-wise between 4s and 5 is hardly noticeable, as iphone runs smooth from the first iphone. unlike android, that needs monster-hardware to run &quot;better&quot;. i'm an android user, but never satisfied with my phone. i keep upgrading my phone to a better one, one with better specs, still it lags.</text>

    <text>i am running ios7. i have had every iphone ever and have also been a blackberry user. generally a cell phone nerd to be honest. i was excited to install the ios as i was looking forward to a revamped look at the new features. after 24h i want to revert. the beta is extremely stable so this has nothing to do with bugs or anything. the look is just very young, and has taken apple closer to android / windows but in the worse way possible. people who bought iphones bought them to belong to a certain brand, that had a defined look and yes the androids of this world always had better features but that was not the point. now when i look at my iphone, i don't feel like i have an apple product anymore. apple was uncompromising under jobs, &quot;take it or leave it&quot;. with this new design, apple is not innovating, they are turning in another the direction and following the pack. i never thought i would say this in 2013, but blackberry may have a play to make here in wooing serious phone users, people who want a unique ui, and people who just like to differentiate themselves from the mass. i understand why steve jobs was against the flat design that john ivey was pushing for so much. he understood that it wasn't about accessing the flashlight on the lockscreen (ios7 has that), it was about belonging to a defined brand with a defined identity.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is a nice looking phone but not better than the my note 2 and htc one because there damm fast and damm cheap than the iphone 5 and if u r confused between iphone 5, s4,htc one . . here is my opinion if u want an stylish looking phone go for xperia z if u want premium quality phone go for iphone 5 or htc one if u want an ugly looking with lots of many gestures and an cheap way of expanding memory go for s4..........</text>

    <text>hi guys last night my iphone screen suddenly went black like it is dead. no function or key or any charging was working. then i searched from net where it was adviced to perform reset by pressing sleep and home button simultaneously.i did that and my iphone started. the same thing happened after 5 minutes again. i again performed a reset by repeating the process and after the device is working fine till now. is there any issue to worry for? should i visit service centre or is it normal? pls reply soon. i m worried</text>

    <text>dear friends after i sold my 4s year back shifted to android used s3,note 2 and thought about to buy s4 but came back to iphone5  android good platform but hang and lags lot.sometimes get stuck we have to reset. lots of bugs,lots of unwanted advertisement while using apps,lots of apps but low quality.example when we install a particular app from play store we can see two to three unwanted apps get installed along with it and we can view it on home screen. samsung when they released s3 it was us$700 during 2012 but today s3 cost around us$480(quality remains same) same way s4 within a month around us$80 was reduced.so who ever buy the mobile at release are fooled. apple excellent built quality,good quality apps,no hang or lags,price wont get reduce suddenly like samsung, ios 6.1.2 had good battery backup but now 6.1.4 sucks even though am waiting for ios7 which will be a best ios ever.apple for ever</text>

    <text>htc , samsung and other android devices produces phones which have loads of feature but you hardly use them. and worst of all android phones drains out the battery very quick with compare to ios. iphone5 all the way. simple, straight forward and all the features are for your use.</text>

    <text>had it 48 hrs now its white one...its not first iphone 5 had black one when first come but sent it back had 2 chips in it.  is nippier than 4s if you can believe it, its opens bejewelled 6 seconds earlier..i use 3d bench mark and;  4s=time to run it 18.1 seconds at 27.56 fps 5=time to run it 11.53 seconds at 43.25 fps  it feels like when i moved from iphone 4 to 4s you think 4 is smooth and fast but each iteration brings speed inprovements..camera is faster and video in low light drops no frames and is fluid.  battery life feels same with 12% left about 7pm at night ready for night charge ready for 7am next morning.i would say i am medium user but hammer any smartphone and it will last 3-4hrs except razr maxx or note.  i cant tell photos are any better its all about good light and keeping lens clean they are just fine and does me..video i am interested in and its very good and so is audio through headphones but speaker crackles/distorts a bit at full blast whereas 4s does not.  overall if i was advising anyone i would still go for the more robust 4s and save money.if you want latest and bigger screen go for 5 it is more 2013 than 4s.i did a deal on my 5 and would advise anyone with money to buy 5 to wait and see what 5s/6 brings,may as well its not far off.  you are sort of getting the same thing whether you use 4s or 5 but iphone 4 camera is terrible it ruined so many shots i could not recommend it unless don't care about cam and just want to try iphone for first time.</text>

    <text>the iphone 5 has a great display. but with the 1080p panels on the htc one/galaxy s4, apple will need to step up.  the 1080p displays (minus the xperia z) are very,very good looking and better then the iphone 5. please make atleast a 720p or even better a 1080p :).  and yes, i have a iphone 5.</text>

    <text>let's go back to the classic days of 4s eventually designed under steve's management it was called the fast 4ward phone a great mark for speed.iphone 5 brings you a bit out of iphone lines as the model hs be stretched to about 4.2 or 4.3 inches kills users with its looks, it's work on the rear is simply awesome the width remain unchanged due to one hand usage but iphone 5 is the slimmest and lightest phone designed by apple, and i have recently updated it to ios 6.1.3 and its triple core graphics enables a super streamline of gameplay making it a favorite phone applicable to all, without age limits the disadvantages are in times of quad core systems it has 1.2 ghz dual core engine powered in apple a6 chipset it has been also noted as the iphones first lte phone and nfc makes iphone complete my recomendation is to buy if you can afford it atleast have a wifi in home for best performence.</text>

    <text>hey friends - just found out an easy way to use personalised ringtones instead of the proprietory ones installed in the iphone 5 without using itunes. simply download the free version of 'xilisoft iphone ringtone maker 3.0.10 build 20121111' from the xilisoft homepage. install it in the pc then find the serial no. from google for the above mentioned version. now follow the steps mentioned within the software. try it, it's really easy.</text>

    <text>i would never buy another iphone 5. the phone does not ring, and apple wants me to pay $69.99, which is a discounted fee, in order to have them fix a 6 month old phone that doesn't ring. to me, that makes no sense, especially seeing as this will only guarantee it for 30 days.</text>

    <text>the best phone. i believe it is still the fastest phone in the market right now. you cant compare that to android. i used to have 4s. after using it for a year and a half. the performance is still the same. fast!! all i need in an smartphone is in my iphone 5 i dont need no air gestures or remote to my tv. samaung is just putting that things on their phones to impress buyers. but you cant really use them everyday. iphone is durable. reliable. and simply smart enough for real smart people. peace samsung.</text>

    <text>hi guys &amp; gals, i have a serious difficulty choosing between iphone 5 and xperia z. i hope you can give me your sincere opinion. i used the iphone 5 that i got as a gift for 3 months before losing it in a taxi. now i need to replace this phone today. i stumbled upon the xperia z in a store and it seemed cool both from the looks and the features that sony claimed it boasts. i am confused as i am now not sure whether to go for the iphone 5 or the xperia z. can those who have had the opportunity of using both phones help me by stating which one they'd go for and for what reason? your help will be most appreciated.</text>

    <text>the phone is great especially for web browsing and its so fast and quite easy to work.  the only major bad thing about this phone is the battery life.  with all the functions the phone has you want to use it all the time like a computer but battery life is so poor i have to have a battery charger on me all the time.  it wont even last half a day if your using it alot.  they should have made it thicker to add a bigger battery life.  it needs to be doubled in order to be up to the standard of the phones capabilities.</text>

    <text>to choose a smartphone, you should know your preference first. i personally think that ios is an better os as it's smoother, simpler to operate, better apps quality, and apple did long term software support for each idevice unlike most of the other android devices. although it has only duo core, but definitely, it has higher ability to run great games (some 2gb games with superb graphic), apps and even some fascinating jailbreak tweaks. i love android too, just state what are the advantages of an iphone. enjoy!</text>

    <text>hey! i got my iphone 5 as a birthday gift. that was about 1 month ago. until then i ve never had an iphone. been using nokia since 2000. i could choose between s4 s3 and htc one. i took a good friends advice and settled with the iphone. i honestly must say that im amazed. the camera on the phone is brilliant, it records like a video camera. also its really easy and intuitive to use. everything seems to be where t should. android based phones are more juiced up lets say but the feel and usage of the iphone are unbelivable. furthermore it doesnt lag, i can open all my apps and still get the same response ehen wrtting an email or playing a video game. i have some cons also. the baterry life is poor in my opinion, you can use the phone for just one day with wifi and 3g on. ive been used with my e72 which could go on for a matter of several days. besides that the iphone 5 is the best phone for me. hope ive helped people who are in doubt on what to buy! cheers from romania!</text>

    <text>hey guys...if u wanna know a real and unbiased opinion, then read this. in terms of usability and reliability, just go for iphone 5.  iphone 5 hardware maybe low compared to most high end android phones; ios makes better out of it. iphone 5 may only have 1gig of ram but most 3d games runs smoothly in ios than a 2gig ram on android.  apple products have only one disadvantage, proprietary.  if you don't mind the bucks and only care for quality in both hardware and software; go for iphone 5.</text>

    <text>the &quot;iphone 5&quot; is the very best &amp; &amp; &amp; the worst iphone ever too! its full of problems. very first unite was defective with its aluminum unibody i.e. dent, broken sleep/wake button, purple tint on camera. now first unit's issues has been gone &amp; new issues has been introduced i.e. slow to respond or hangs home &amp; sleep/wake button, camera not functioning randomly or permanently.  here is my experiences with iphone 5: 1. i have brought an iphone 5 (most provably one of the first unite) immediately when its was released with some dents. after two or three months i got problem with sleep/wake button. it was broken due to very soft material used on it. 2. so, then apple had changed my iphone with new one. surprisingly that one had not any dent &amp; i noticed they have changed the sleep/wake, silent buttons &amp; the volume rocker with different materials which is more dark (black) and hard. but i discovered a big issue that, the home and the sleep/wake buttons was not responding randomly. the screen went off &amp; couldn't be turned on due to not responding buttons. 3. again, apple had replaced my iphone with new one. that time camera didn't work. so, i had sent that to the apple again. 4. and yes, they have change that again with another new device without asking any question. but after two days i have gotten the problem again that is &quot; the home and the sleep/wake buttons was not responding randomly&quot; and this time is more frequeint!  so, now what should i do? will i go to apple's genius bar again to get another new faulty device???</text>

    <text>there have been numerous rumors claiming that apple is working on an iphone with a larger screen to compete with phones from competitors like samsung, but tim cook's comments during today's q2 financial results call indicate that the company is not quite ready to make a phone with a 5-inch screen. my view continues to be that iphone 5 has the best display in the industry. we always strive to create the very best display. some customers value large screen size. others value other factors such as resolution, color quality, white balance, reflectivity, power consumption, compatibility of apps, and portability. our competitors have made some significant tradeoffs in many of these areas to ship a larger display. we would not ship a larger display iphone while these tradeoffs exist. it appears that apple will not be releasing an iphone with a larger screen until the company's manufacturing partners can supply it with a 5-inch screen that meets its demanding criteria.</text>

    <text>well this phone wouldn't be too bad, because it has nice ui, etc, but it is poor quality, indeed only 1 year warranty, plus this is way too overpriced for it's value, there are better products from competition that have better quality, they even sell it for smaller price. so to sum up, a great phone, but not worth it's money, however if you like apple, you might not have much of a choice.</text>

    <text>iphone5 is still made the same way like a decade ago: made from cheap aluminum,totally super cheap material.  whereas the current smartphones are made from ultra durable super premium synthetic ceramic; iphone5 uses ordinary glass; whereas some are now using indestructible japanese asahi glass. iphone5 still uses the obsolete a5 chip only in dual core. whereas most are using high tech snapdragon chips. iphone5 os is still the obsolte ios a decade ago. blackberry 10 is the best, followed by android; where as apple os is very far behind, say ten steps backwards. most of all iphones are made in some decrepit cottage industry in bangladesh the subcontractor of foxconn. and then sold one million times profit margin from its actual manufacturing cost of just over thirty dollars us$30. if you come to asia, you will see macbooks and iphones sold in the side street but no takers even sold at dirt cheap buy one take one because it sucks</text>

    <text>first time user of iphone 5 after many years of being a blackberry user. wish i was a little more patient and waited for the bb z10. mechanically the iphone is great but software wise it is well short of expectation. battery lasts a day at best.no file manager for starters and the list goes on. a huge disappointment after all the media hype. common apple, give the consumer what they want instead of milking us at every opportunity , itunes et al !!!!   disgusted</text>

    <text>iphone is definitely the best phone in the market.it has a better app store than android's google play.i tried using my cousin's samsung galaxy ace duos and when i tried to download temple run,a bunch of useless apps came with the temple run download.it really sucks.and also,when i tried surfing facebook on it (my cousin didn't download the official facebook app because she said it takes too much memory,which i understand so i decided to use the built-in internet app instead.) and it lags like hell! i'm not used to surf on lag devices so,i closed the app.what brags me the most is that my non-android phone,samsung corby ii (this is a budget phone) surfs smoother than her android device although there's like 4 apps running in the background.i also tried my friend's iphone 5 and it doesn't lag at all! :d</text>

    <text>the &quot;iphone 5&quot; is the very best &amp; &amp; &amp; the worst iphone ever too! its full of problems. very first unite was defective with its aluminum unibody i.e.  dent, broken sleep/wake button, purple tint on camera. now first unit's issues has been gone &amp; new issues has been introduced i.e. slow  to respond or hangs home &amp; sleep/wake button, camera not functioning randomly or permanently.  here is my experiences with iphone 5: 1. i have brought an iphone 5 (most provably one of the first unite) immediately when its was released with some dents. after two or three months i got problem with sleep/wake button. it was broken due to very soft material used on it. 2. so, then apple had changed my iphone with new one. surprisingly that one had not any dent &amp; i noticed they have changed the sleep/wake, silent buttons  &amp; the volume rocker with different materials which is more dark (black) and hard. but i discovered a big issue that, the home and the sleep/wake buttons was not responding randomly. the screen went off &amp; couldn't be turned on due to not responding buttons. 3. again, apple had replaced my iphone with new one. that time camera didn't work. so, i have sent that to the apple again. 4. now i'm waiting for another new iphone 5 provably with some new issues. to be continued...</text>

    <text>well, the iphone 5 is a good enough phone for the casual user, who only wants to call others, make occasional photos,surf the web, and use mainstream apps. but its price tag, especially for this hardware, is quite inflated.  however, and this will come as a shock for many, the iphone 5 is not a smartphone in its own right (at least from my point of view). this is because ios does not have certain features. in my mind for a device to be considered a smartphone, it's os should have true multitasking, app integration, a system-wide file manager, as well as an application market. as ios doesn't actually have the first 3 features (despite all of apple's propaganda), it should only be regarded as a semi-smartphone.  don't get me wrong, for 95+% of users, a semi-smartphone is more than enough to satisfy their needs. this combined with its good looks, the absence of lags(unlike android, which is a true, if very heavy os), huge numbers of apps, as well as very aggresive marketing on the part of apple, has ensured that every iphone will sell well. don't get me wrong, i liked the iphone 5 initially but after 2 months i got rid of it and turned to android. the iphone would be a great device if it were to cost about 400 euros at launch.</text>

    <text>acting like that towards people with genuine criticism just makes people want to criticise more out of spite for the intolerance of people like you, and with my last comment i had something to say and i said it, and just out of spite for your intolerance i could easily flood this section with my own posts because of you and ruin it for everyone else but that depends on how you treat people who have criticism from now on.</text>

    <text>well iphone 5 is a great phone after all and it's the best most beauty smartphone that i ever had. i think we can't to comparing iphone 5 with sgs3 because their os is different. i mean, if ios is an open source just like an android and sgs with that specs use an ios, than the sgs is the unbeatable smartphone! because the iphone 5 with an ios and it's dual core processor is can to compete the sgs3 with an android and it's huge quad core processor.  and when i look the sgs4 specs, it makes me thing that apple must be create the superior iphone to beat the sgs4 :|</text>

    <text>there are only two that i would like for apple to do. first they should add sdcard slot in order to expand the memory; the one was, they should increase the display size of coming iphones. increase of size but moderately. even not on par with the samsungs 5 to 6 inches cause they were too big to handle. 4.8 inches would be the most appropriate size of smartphone.</text>

    <text>the truth and honest opinion from my experience.i was using galaxy s3 for 8 month.but i wasn't that much happy.cause although i have updated it to jb there is still some lagging on the os.the whole experience like ur opening multiple layer of an app and when u switch them ur actually opening the apps again.on apple side apps are designed like they act like they are part of whole os and ur not actually switching apps,ur exploring the part of the whole os.another problem of s3 is display is over-saturated.it really give u misinterpret of a pic or app design pattern by over-saturated color,although movie watching is great.i really like about iphone 5 is its a clean in design,display size and color accuracy .it  is good for mobile device which it should be.ios has a clean os interface although it has some limitation.if u want to customize ios get apps of ur desire which is key point of any os in market.with proper apps installed on ur ios device i think ios is more fast,fluid,polished,and great to work with everyday.</text>

    <text>i agree that iphone 5  is one of the best phones out there, but if we take the price point it's not worth it. cause iphone 5 = 45000 inr (900$) we can get any android phone with same (or higher) features around 25000 to 40000 inr (500$ to 800$) so why spend more????????</text>

    <text>apple remains the best. others may have too much of this, more of that but iphones are ideal and consistent in quality and user experience. so if u're looking to have a tv as mobile phone, why not hang ur lcd/plasma tvs on ur neck like flavour flav uses his wall clock. all i ask more of apple is 'normal bluetooth sharing' of media items (images, audio, video), documents,...even if it just with apple devices, then file manager app, and also serve as a mobile memory drive that can access files and folders when plugged to any pc ....but that 's kinda asking too much.  thanks as we anticipate this in the next upgrade. hailing from nigeria, west africa</text>

    <text>the truth about the matter is, the hottest phine on the market is blackberry z10. basically all the apps on apple are there plus u can sideload android apps on the new blackberry. wat more can u ask for? plus it has a bigger screen that iphone 5 and the graphics are better. the front camera is better too with  2mp instead of 1.2mp. also the ram is 2gb while iphone 5 is 1gb ram. ive used iphone 5 and the z10 and honestly the z10 is a better experience and is more use friendly</text>

    <text>if you want to buy a baby rattle mobile its okey.i have bought it december 2012 from the begging when i was just shake it i was hearing a click noice from the camera area i took it back to the carrier (wind.gr)they kept it from february 2013 until 6 of march and they told me that all iphone5 have this noise by default. i contact apple support and i told them that vodafone.gr and cosmote.gr make replacement for this kind of problem.still i am waiting for answer about my issue still i don't have my 740,00 euro phone. so my opinion before buying it open the box and shake it. after sale policy for i phone does not exist,and because i am telling the truth apple support case number: 421288645</text>

    <text>5 reasons why i choose andriods over iphones  1. there are more ways to customize your phone with andriod  2. all andriods built&amp;#65279; since 2012 have wayyy better processors then the iphone 5  3. widgets!!!!!  4. in my opinion the iphone backrounds are ugly u just stare at ur apps....  5. androids are all diverse as to an iphone u get an iphone 4 or the same phone with an s put in to the name or a slightly better i phone 5.</text>

    <text>i really don't understand why you guys like to argue which is the best. buying a smartphone is alike to choosing a partner. everyone has different taste. end of the day what's most important is you like &quot;her&quot;. who cares what other think. so be it apple,samsung,htc,lg or nokia they are just phones. both my gf and i choose iphone5, for it's slim metallic design and retina display.we just love the display on iphone. also the lightweight and small feel, that's our preference.</text>

    <text>so disaappointed with apple! i love the phone however i went into apple store today and the salesman was rude! generally i've been into the store and they are helpful and polite! surely the iphone is a premium phone but can't say that about the salesman today! i don't care how premium the product is and will not buy another product as i don't tolerate rudeness! farewell apple!</text>

    <text>app developers need paying for their work and hours they put in ,,android cripples you with adverts to pay for free apps apple dont..these app folk spend hours developing and should be paid..folk expect stuff for free these days but it is not...everytime you buy an android device you are buying an advertising portal to which google can stuff you to death with adverts.</text>

    <text>if you want to have a hassle free phone, much more better to be with samsung or android phones. iphone's are anti piracy. and they secured every gadgets w/ itunes. w/c is for their business. most apps needs to be paid before you can download them w/c is unfair, because iphone is already expensive so why should their apps have some pricess as well. make no sense. they love money!</text>

    <text>samsung make the audio chip too,sharp the screen and so on..apple re-engineered that a6 chip with 1000 engineers they reckon to do what it does and with superb battery efficiency..  apple only have to make one version of the app as such because they only have one device to make it for except screen size differences. most apps are developed for ios first because its easy to do with only one device but there is another reason and also why games go to ios first but cant remember why..</text>

    <text>bought an iphone 5 32gb black last week and it's cool! i cannot deny that android is a very advance operating system but are all the devices optimized?  don't be blinded by those quad-cores, octo-cores or anything because not all apps are capable of using all those cores. some apps are just designed for dual-cores just like the iphone 5.  talking about apps, not all apps are suitable for a specific android device because of all the varieties of android devices in the market but in iphone 5, all apps in the app store are all compatible though some of the apps are still in 640x960 but wait for few weeks they will already be 640x1136.  android os is a very nice os indeed, in fact, i own an android device.  android is for those who are excited for full customization but ios is for those who are just too lazy to customize. android is advance and customer-tractable but how about bugs? yes, you can get updates for your android device but most of the time, they are getting released months after and still carrying bugs! and if you're going to buy an android device, wait for 2-3 years and it's already stagnant compared to iphones that can last up to 3-4 years.  if i have to decide between operating systems, i will choose both, because i am that kind of consumer who loves both! sometimes i need android and sometimes i need ios.  if you think you need a fully-customizable os that can allow you to download songs, videos, movies and 3rd party apps easily, go for android!  if you think you need something simple that has less bugs and just sticks to the hand and you know for sure that you are financially capable in buying original songs and applications, go for ios!  if you think you are financially upright, better buy both!</text>

    <text>just switched across from samsung s3 and so much better experience. with both apple/samsung/blackberry it really is just a case of the users preferences. i prefer the ease of use of the ios operating system. i've had no problems as yet with the &quot;paint&quot; on the phone coming off or scratching, battery life seems to be fine-with regular usage of apps and games etc i do have to charge once a day but its a smartphone, its what its there for! truly brilliant experience overall-cannot find fault with it (yet!).</text>

    <text>as long as you keep away from that little spot ,all ok..if i put my finger across that gap the signal did drop..you can always put a piece of cellotape across it..it is the best your going to do for cheapest price to get an iphone..i found it just as fluid but the newer ones speed things up  a bit but it was still fluid.  its up to you, s4 is a month off and if your just after iphone to put you on then  iphone 4 will give you near enuf same experiance as iphone 5 but no siri.the biggest thing is how much you will lose in money if you buy one then sell it..if its not much then nothing to lose..i am uk and the iphone 4 still is expensive.</text>

    <text>the best mobile ever! i bought it an white iphone 5 i recommand everyone should buy an iphone. i was an android user. i used samsung s2,s3,note and even the note tab n8000. i can say even how much samsung or any other brands puts octa cores in their handsets. the main key is the os. not the specs of the device. see for yourselves. even android is having octa core precessors now and apple is having dual cores. apple's dual cores are way faster than android's octa cores. i say it again. the specs are not important. try the usability of the device and the os. god bless apple</text>

    <text>back to basics - what are phones meant for - calling, texting. the extras - playing games, watching videos, clicking pictures, checking mails on the go, maps. well, the iphone does all of this with style. unlike android doesn come with glitches or hangs or crashes. in the end android is just another open sourceware linux based system. the ios is a independent, highly developed multimillion invest os. the competitors might come with better specs and features. iphone comes with standard yet high quality specs. 8 mp, 4&quot;, retina display, aluminium casing and manages to be simple yet effective. i use a iphone and i am in love with it. i don need to worry about new arrivals in the market because i still know - if u don't have an iphone, you don't have an iphone.</text>

    <text>this phone with its 1440 battery and 1gb ram is faster and last longer then most phones out there.. its 64gb is only 16gb less then most phones out there.. (those with 16gb+64gb sdcard) &amp; (samsung announce 32gb/64gb with slot .. but i never seen one sold)  apple only have limited features, they only want features that works very well and all the time. it has no nonsense features, stuff that is gimmicky and half baked.  downside is maybe people might get tired of its smaller screen and plain looks, but it never degrade what it delivers.</text>

    <text>one of the most stable and fast phone i have ever seen, much better than samsung. battery life is too good as compare to other smartphones in market. i also got iphone 2 and it still working, so i have no doubts on iphone 5 in terms of reliability. iphone 5 has got excellent camera. just don't go by mega pixel (can 13 mp dslr camera and 13 mp phone can give same results... just think about it). its 1 gb ram is good to run apps designed for iphone 5. value for money phone. only drawback - flash based web content will not get displayed.</text>

    <text>appe must not listen to clamors of a bigger and wider screen iphone for my own opinion, iphone have the right size its easy to put in the pocket, belt case and it is very comfortable in the hand unlike from the competition it is short of a phablet , not comfortable  in the hand and pocket, instead apple must increase the lifespan of the iphone battery ,etc.</text>

    <text>do you guys know what is so funny about all of this iphone vs samsung war?  let me break it down for you:  the reason why there is so much bickering from the android side is because the s4 is really not much different than the s3. sure, it's just logical bump in hardware specs. yes, they have added a ton of software improvements and thrown in a bunch of gimmicky features. there seems to be lack of innovation claims from the nerd herd side of the green trash can.  apple has gone stale with ios 6.0 they have not done much to innovate either. the iphone is 4&quot; and yet it's so tiny, i hardly use it to web surf, do any real multimedia and even gaming on it is really pathetic compared to an ipad mini/ipad 4.  the real reason why you see an s4 the way it is now before your eyes is because samsung could not copy apple any further. unless apple is planning on a huge redesign on their next gen iphone (6), it seems samsung has copied all it can copy up until iphone 4(s)/5 models. they have utterly finished photocopying and analyzing apple's designs, it's dried up all of their &quot;innovations&quot;.  so you see, when the real next generation iphone arrives, you will see samsung will have to release a new device and then the nerd herd will oooh and awe over how great the device is. at it's current form, (the s4) is really just a rehash of the same old same old.  argue all you want about how samsung doesn't copy; the reality is their copy machines are just stuck in standby mode at the moment. it won't start up again until apple makes a good move on their next gen hardware and software</text>

    <text>in my opinion this a great phone. although i wouldn't mind having my iphone afew millimeters thinker to incorporate a fm receiver with rds, stereo sound speakers, infra-red port for universal remote features and last but not least nfc connectivity. i definitely think these few additions would make the iphone the ultimate multimedia phone.  nb: not necessary but if you could consider switching from the proprietary connector to standard usb port for data transfer and charging it would be most convenient for a lot of iphone users.  besides that, on the software side i think ios is way ahead of it competition as the most advanced and reliable mobile os so far. keep up the good job apple. thumbs up!!!</text>

    <text>apple is very nervous of the samsung galaxy s4 unveiling so they came out with this advertisement.  &quot;since thursday, when samsung introduced its latest flagship android smartphone, 99.99% of the buzz has about thesamsung galaxy s 4, freezing out theapple iphone 5. if there is one thing that apple hates, it is being frozen out of the news cycle by its rival. it just isn't good for sales of the apple iphone and apple ipad if everyone is sitting glassy-eyed, panting and drooling over pictures and descriptions of the samsung galaxy s 4.the samsung galaxy s 4 could outsell the apple iphone this year and this is making apple nervous. so apple retaliated by putting up a page on its website that is titled &quot;there's iphone and then there's everything else&quot;.</text>

    <text>this phone is still the best imo. coming from using some of the best phones of 2012.. like nexus 4 samsung s3.  here are my personal feeling about it: 1. very smooth phone compared to the other android phones i have.. it's hard to explain this part.. it's like when you scroll.. the ui sticks to your hand. very responsive. 2. small and easy to hold.. it's a phone with a very small profile, easy to carry around.. but this point is not really good as it around the same as n4 or my s3 3. the screen is very visible under sunlight compared to my n4 or s3.. very good in the outdoors. 4. when you have previous iphones, you can retain its data.. so to me my iphone 5 is not just a iphone5 phone.. but rather my personal phone, that have seen everything i did since 3gs.  but that's just me.. sorry that i am not geeky or know about who has better specs so i couldn't back up my observation with technical terms.</text>

    <text>i've been doing some hard thinking over the last couple of days on the iphone5 and i have come to the following conclusion:. iphone5 is pretty much a iphone1 except different shape faster cpu 4g lte, better camera etc etc. the actual os software is the same as the iphone1 ios is so stale right now its just a deluge of icons. no screen transision menus, widgets, diagrams or animation at all like android has. ios is a very basic menu system and everyone has a iphone so the novelty value is no longer there anymore. i think i'll be picking up a s4 or htc one for my next upgrade.</text>

    <text>again, the battery of iphone 5 is really not good. i dont know why it can do so well in the battery test in this site and still be so bad in real life usage.  one of my friends who have iphone 5, a young girl, used to bring a portable powerbank for her ip5, but even that was not enough so now she bring an additional phone, a nokia feature phone, instead of the power bank.  next time you hear someone say ios is so optimized that it does not need big battery then you know you have a liar in front of you, or someone who have never used and iphone 5.</text>

    <text>iphone needs to use the standard 1080p display and not their odd &quot;retina&quot; display! 1080p is used not only on phones but is also used on bigscreen tv..., so it makes it very easy to simply mirror the phone screen to the bigscreen tv...! i think a phone with a 4.5 inch 1080p screen would be perfect, big enough for surfing on the internet and watch movies, but still small enough to be used as a phone... with only one hand!</text>

    <text>the overall build of the phone is good, but if you drop if off once then its gone.. the build the finish is all gone...   apple's concept of keeping the display small is worth the idea.  the main problem with it is the same old boring ui interface and there is no flash support for a phone that costs you around half a lakh.  you cant play flash videos on it...and cant download anything new to it until you connect it to pc</text>

    <text>apple has done it again, however i wish the body design was a little more ergonomically forward, (see nokia lumia 920 and htc 8x)conventional wisdom states; always wait for the beta version i.e. 3gs as opposed to 3g, 4s as opposed to 4, 5s as opposed to 5 and so on and so forth.................</text>

    <text>until now you guys always saying iphone ui is out dated, old, you dont really get it do you? apple is making it same old experience even better when they release a new iphone, they improve performance, quality of apps, camera, battery life isn't this we all need in a mobile phone? so instead of bashing some negativity on this phone why not use an android &amp; an iphone at the same time then you decide whose better, iv been an android user long before than an ios user, ios works for me better that android and il stick to it</text>

    <text>ive used android in the past, and although it is a good os what ive found is the build quality of the brands that use android are not. samsung..... please,.. u use the fone for a few months and problems start happening. ive had 2 androids both didnt last a year. that is the difference between iphone vs the rest. iphone is expensive for a reason, it mite not have the best features but its the best, quality wise. you want a fone that will outlast your contract, go for iphone. if you like to change fones every year because of constant problems go android.</text>

    <text>dear galaxy s3/note (what ever) &amp; apple 5 user. i have both s3 &amp; apple i5. just to underline basic difference. i phone is &quot;the only phone&quot; with lots of feature and no one can compete with it (till date). it gives u compact size phone wwhich is easy to handle. fits in ur pocket u donot have to carry it in hands. feature wise u can have quad etc core ram, x mp camera x pixel display etc. but do they really matter, when the basic feature which attracted all is &quot;mobility&quot; of carrying a device. you cannot compare note with other &quot;mobile&quot; catogery devices.</text>

    <text>hi guys i want your opinion since i am not that into technology and stuff. so i am stuck between two phones i consider buying the iphone 5 or samsung galaxy s3 but i do not know which one i might choice because they are truly good phones both of them. so decision making is quite hard. however i do not care about the hardware and stuff i just like a phone that has a good camera, good loudspeakers and sound quality cause i like taking pictures and listen to music. could someone help me?</text>

    <text>nothing new or innovative. i don't understand all the fuss. it's just a normal, almost mediocre phone, especially when compared to all the other high-end phones out there.  i don't know if apple is going through a slump or something, but i honestly see no reason to buy this phone.</text>

    <text>extremely good phone.  bought it after a 2 year experience with androids   can really feel the difference. the bulid quality is very nice.  its performance is the best. no lags. no issues.   now owning it since a month. really great phone. i have a black iphone and feel that it looks better than the white one.</text>

    <text>i acquired the iphone 5 this past few days and i'm very excited about it.  it was stated that it has a wlan of a/b/g/n just like the ipad 3.  why is it after using battery doctor app and read its specifications, it has only 802.11 b/g/n?  is the app not that accurate or the iphone 5 really has the b/g/n wlan?  can somebody share opinions on this matter?</text>

    <text>stupid me!  i was told the galaxy s3 was the greatest phone.  i switched to it.  it was good at first, then it started lagging, as i got more applications.  then it started slowing down more.   now the battery life is poor.  the thing is i don't want to carry an extra set of batteries with me every day. i  was living in denial.  i kept on giving it a chance! but it's failed me. switching to the galaxy s3 is the biggest mistake i've ever made.  !@#$ sakes. never going to android again.  wtf is wrong with people telling me the gs3 is the greatest thing?   my ip4 has fewer issues, sure its inferior to the gs3, but wtf was i thinking! when does the 5s come out?  no more android for me.</text>

    <text>this is the best iphone really light waight really professional looking easy to use no complicated options simple and smart phone.the battery stays two days ,if you use the phone normal without 3g and only using wifi time to time love iphone 5,even if you had open all the apps in the phone phone doesnt even become little slow. never had issues with calls really hight quality sounds  please avoid posting wrong comments about this phone this is a really good phone  only issue;thre was a signal drop but it was fixed by ios 6.1.2  used a htc onex and a samsung s3 really bad phones cheap plastics if we leave applications open the phone gets stuck ,the phone gets stuck middle of calls ,phone restarts time to time really good i reccommend this phone</text>

    <text>obviously iphone 5 is technically not the best mobile phone available on market today, but the truth is apple products are beautifully designed and all the features in it are giving attention to detail unlike other brands just bloated their phones with tons of impressive features which you can't really apply all of them in daily life. the differences are just barely noticeable if you're just an ordinary consumer.</text>

    <text>simply the best!!  i have owned each model of iphone since their first iphone and i must say iphone is the best iphone yet. i upgraded from my 4s and at first i thought a slightly speed bump and another extra 0.5&quot; display won't win over me but boy weren't i wrong.  for those of 4s owners who are hesitating, let me list some experience to ease your doubt: 1. the display is superb! i'm not a tech guy who knows everything about the technology behind and i don't care, it's just the display on the 5 is a lot more superb. i know the color is a bit more saturated but the real joy is the display is like right on the phone (not you know it's a few layers under the mirror), if you know what i mean. the extra screen is very welcome in most apps.  2. the speed is fast, not so much faster than the 4s but once you used the 5 for a few days it will make your 4s a lot slower. more like you go back from 4s to 4. it is difference.  3. the lighter weight is very convenience for holding to use. you wouldn't think it's much different but when you sleep and use and text is a lot more convenience. you will use less effort to do everything on it and the slimness is outstanding. even with case you will appreciate the effort of the engineer behind to make it this slim. i bet the technology of the display plays a role in it.  so for those who think you should upgrade or not, well, if you live in countries where you tied to contract you may not interested. but if you can freely change like in my country, no doubt that it is a better phone than 4s. by a lot, not just lighter and bigger screen. the user experience is a lot better.  for those who are using, 4 or below, just get the damn new phone! and for those who are using android 4-core so-called super giant kicking phone, please continue living with lag-butter ui and call it a day. no offense but i owned both s3 and butterfly.  thanks.</text>

    <text>this is my first iphone. and all i can say is the battery life is far from adequate. i don't understand how apple could fit this life of battery to a energy draining specs. to get 5 hrs of usage i have to turn off most features. is this a smartphone? i think i made a mistake by switching from other phone to this phone. it is good looking but it is not a furniture just sit at living room.</text>

    <text>ok guys. if iphone 5 is really the best smartphone, then why is it not on the daily interest list neither the user rating list? you still need to go to search for iphone 5 so you can see it. as i can see there are a lot of bitter apple defenders on this page.  i have both s3 and i5. yes, the i5 is fast, no lag, but it is boring. almost all apps are paid and i dont want to jb it. i prefer android phones than apple's. why?  apple has no:  - sdcard slot - removable battery - customizable home screen, launchers - widgets - usb function - wifi tethering - wifi direct - nfc - radio - root function  let's just say that apple phones are only for not-so-techie people that loves to throw their money.</text>

    <text>bought a new iphone 5 just a 2 days back. this phone had a camera flash issue. the apple people told me to get replaced but only the mobile device not the full box that too i should wait for 1 week. the re seller never helps in this issue even though it was just a day happened after the sale. so please dont buy apple without checking at shop itself. as it has lots of bug and hardware problem. the customer care is worst with apple.</text>

    <text>i love the iphone however, will not buy another one again! the first one had died and apple admitted that i had a hardware problem. the second one had paint chip problems and was chipping off at the edges after the 2nd day! i think the design is great and even better the is the ease of use but i think apple has really been over priced and not doing themselves any favours in terms of market share!</text>

    <text>i love apple products iv used 3gs &amp; 4s.. my 3gs lasted for 3years &amp; 5mnths b4 it gave up on me.. just got my 4s 2mnths ago i was thinking of getting the 5 but decided to stick to the 4s im happy with a 3.5 screen. just wanna share my opinion about how other cellphone companies innovate.. u can definitely c they work really hard to step up there game even to the weirdest &amp; most practical way to make our life more simple.. from wireless charging. but for me wireless charging is not for me. for me even the notification light is one the best ideas. it could save time &amp; even ur battery life.. unlike the iphne ul need to unlock the screen to check if u have a msg or miscall &amp; that activates ur screen sucking energy. u see other companies able to squeeze that in there products. yes they made ur led flash blink wen u have a notification but that was it. why cant they put an led in the home button or even at the side. they are able to put it in there laptop products why not in there line of iphnes? am i asking to much? just my opinion..</text>

    <text>the main desadvantage of apple products is that u'll not be able to use any other phones i speak from an experience i got my iphone 4 in 2010 &amp; have it till now, the surprising thing is that i never had a prob with it, i updated it till the last version &amp; had concerns that it will lag or something but i never had any i have a second phone now the new iphone5 &amp; so glad with it, i recommad it to everyone that really want to pay for something that reallly deserve dont hesitate from byin an iphone cz u'll never regret it the new iphone (5) is an amazing machine i tried to make it lag with no success it just keep running fast &amp; the new wifi upgrade is a blast it lightingly fast make it better than my home wifi i noticed that the sound is better too (loudspeaker &amp; headphones) compared to my iphone 4 the new cam is gr8 too but the one on the iphone4 is not bad at all i took a very nice collection with it &amp; they are amazing the face detection is a nice touch but in the iphone5 there is a face detection on the front cam wich is unique compared to all of the other phones that doesn't have this feature the panorama is a nice touch i tried it several times &amp; it's good when u want a full sceen the only negative point of it is the new map (in some regions) cz it's not what i expected from apple inc but they are improving it everyday plus the google app is an alternative but never tried it cz i dont use maps that much &amp; what the phone give is enough for me the battery is better than the one on the iphone4 maybe it's because the one on my iphone4 had a nice life the last 3 years the things that i enjoy in the iphone5 is that it's thinner larger &amp; still fitts in my pocket i didnt have a prob with the smaller screen of the iphone4 but the new 4'' screen is gr8 too what makes both of them good is that the resolution is great same ppi (326) &amp; the retina display is always there thx for reading my post i just wanted to share my experience if someone is intereseted best regards .................... mark</text>

    <text>it's true that apple hasn't done too much on internal specs, and they have their phone at a rather high price point...but look at what they are selling to you, a premium smartphone made of anodized aluminum and glass, an os that isn't nearly as power hungry as most android os's are, and its ecosystem and cloud services are far better and more simple to use than anything that deals with android.  so, is the s3 technically better and cheaper than the iphone?  yes, but are u going to like your s3/note ii/whatever more than the iphone 5 if you've tried and given both a chance?  probably not, that's why iphone sales have risen and made new records on apple's earnings.</text>

    <text>comparing to other phones in the market, this phone is impressive, 4s did not have any problem with the speed, comparing to 5 with a6 chipset u wouldn't need any more, just the restriction (itunes) on iphone ios makes it a hater from a lot of user, while the android software is more open source and u can simply drag any file easily.. but still the legend nokia n900 has potentially the best features.. but didn't receive any further updates from nokia .. in developing their own software (maemo), while bb will astonish with the new os10 that rims develops.</text>

    <text>iv used iphone 3gs, htc rhyme, chacha, iphone5 and some galaxy series.  iv been using friends and brothers iphone4 and 4s.  so far iphone 5 has been most impressive. very responsive, fast, stable. everything was perfected. batteries has always been an issue since the new generation of phones came. especially touch screens. htc is always my choice when buying android phones.  the thing with other brands, they manufacture too much variations which were never close to perfection. why invest on a phone which isnt reliable? apple chooses perfection. the only complaint is about some issues with customizing tones using itunes. and incoorporating java would be very nice.</text>

    <text>apple users, just tell when used first iphone, it was having bigger screen then not now how it became a lead. then its demand was never conceived by steve himself, 100%phones leaving us were locked and jailbreak started. initially it wad sold fr200$ with plan but sim at&amp;t was used on another cell amd iphone smuggled out to fareast, africa, indopak and russia.  most of applerr fame came from this illegal trade. now unlocked or factory reset are available. but god is not always bountiful as pinch has started to felt n shares and trend. they need a major break through which is now shining on sony.</text>

    <text>i have samsung noteii (dark blue) and iphone 5 (white). i was using both with data plan. i found that the iphone goes battery dead at around 2pm and samsung last longer until mid of the night. i wanted my iphone to last longer as i love much more than samsung because it right  size for making calls and has better and more quality applications. i came to conclusion that to go for one data package with mobile operator. so i cancelled the data package of the iphone  and kept the data on the samsung phone. now, i am using the samsung as portable wifi for iphone and as well using it for samsung. iphone now last very longer maybe sometime to next day until the battery became dead.</text>

    <text>why do people engage in so much banter regarding phones? do you all get paid to do this or what? all phones are good depending on your taste, i am a blackberry loyalist but i don't have to hate samsung or apple, i use what i prefer. specs are nice but if you are loyal to a product based on past experience specs are not much in an argument. get on with life people, most are adults but this bruhaha is uncalled for.</text>

    <text>that's the secret that nobody is seeing...apple is using their own os. that's why they can support that good. samsung is dependent on google for software. even if they want to, they can't fix a software problem! the debate will go on and on and on. but, in my opinion it's just better and more reliable to use the apple product. and by the way, it is definitely a better product...all around. samsung is good, but android is so mixed up with a lot of manufacturers, that you can choose any phone running on android...it will be the same. difference in hardware is so little and it's running android......apple is one package!!!</text>

    <text>got my lightening cable changed by apple care same day, have never had any service issues with apple. they have the best after sales service. have had many phones in past samsung galaxy htc tytn 2 htc hd nokia communicator etc. but no company gives service like apple. if u buy any apple product you get 100% after sales service. i don't mind paying extra for apple products because of their after sales response. and they also give wonderful option of apple care plans after ur 1 yr warranty is finished.</text>

    <text>hi ...apple is the best comp ever. i have been using android phones for the past 2 yrs and an s3 user for the past 3 months. bought the iphone 5 couple of days back. the first that struck me was this is beautiful , both the hardware and the os. my s3 has a lot more features and it got updated to jelly bean yesterday. i have never felt the need the most of them ( at least for a business user like me ) the only thing that caught my attention is the smart stay but the irony is you have to help the device to stay smart most of the time by holding the phone close to you or stand against a bright source of light. with all the power of quad core , the s3 still hangs and stops for a second or so while opening an app or a picture after the jelly bean update. all this happens for everyday use and not while gaming. finally i have started to understand ios and its simplicity. it works flawless and is pleasing to look at. it comes at a high price tag but i guess it's worth it. my only worry is the home key as you are dependent on it everything you exit to home screen and i hope it lasts for a long time.</text>

    <text>well, i don't understand about you guys. its clear that the android's are much more user friendly that any iphone version. everyone knows it since like what? 4 years ago?  apple is not selling specs, apple is selling design and idea. you gotta give them that. owning an iphone is something. i've had my hands on iphone 3g and its still butter smooth till today. the only reason i won't be using it is because i can't use a simple bluetooth transfer function without modifying it lol.  on the other hand androids are easy to customize and reliable. doesn't make it fast, compared to ios 4, the latest android still lags with all the specs, 4 cores, 1gb ram etc.. you name it.. had my hands on s3 and note 2 its not nice and boring. design is crappy and doesn't feel good on my palm not to mention it's ultimate lag-ness with all the cores lol.  moral of the story is,  design matters in a phone and iphone 5 delivers it. its more like a feel good professional phone rather for the it junkies.  i'm personally using an android because i have no choice. i need the msd card, bluetooth and easy file transfer. but iphones have way better design and they feel way better on hands over any android device.  androids beats iphones on customization on any given day. not to mention the cyanogen mod, aokp, miui  roms which are handy in many many ways.  just choose what you need and buy any phone. they all are good. if you have that extra money, buy an iphone and an android. you wont regret either way.  why this argument?</text>

    <text>the main reason to buy apple products including the new iphone 5 its because no one can afford them or iphone 5. it demeans my image to use a popular product or phone... so i know for a fact not anyone can use and afford iphones and other apple products. no wonder why there are so many loosers who patronize iphone left right and centre. i'm a proud user and carrier of iphone 5..</text>

    <text>paging through all comments, specs and reviews, my personal opinion comes to the following:  nokia was number one, but since moving to windows, all the software reliability is not there anymore. only hardware. if you look at android phones, all software basically the same. so the choice is hardware...make, model, price etc etc. apple is the only product in the market that is not dependent to someone else for software reliability, features etc. so, it's not so complicated anymore! the smartphone market and smartphones in particular, are controlled by the operating system. android phones are dependent on what google gives them, nokia is dependent on microsoft. that leaves me to a logic choice that apple's combination is more acceptable. the specs, performances and looks are personal. but the os is the deciding point. all android phones are working with the same basic os. and windows need to prove itself. master of os, belle/symbian, is not on the market in the near future. so, it leaves me with only one choice...iphone. is the logic wrong?</text>

    <text>i think phone is good wit its features. first of all it has good features like new retina display, good camera quality ,quiet large screen ,new ios but still i think that this phone does not deserve its price . it is too expensive for its features. the features are not bad but still very expensive .45000 we give for this phone and what we get a 16 gb memory with no expansion . no new special features in this phone. apple maps are useless. internet is good in phone touch is smooth and fast but its price is too high as compared to samsung s3 or htc one x . for ex samsung s3 is also quiet expensive but deserves the price . better display size than iphone 5 memory can be expanded after its 16 gb internal memory. has different features and unique features than othert phone like smart stay. its just of rs32000 and iphone is 45500 this is not good .you cant expand the memory . if you want to expand you have to buy 32 or 64 gb iphone which costs more expenisve . this is a very lack feature of this phone. if you buy an ultimate phone so 16 gb memory is not enough to work with . its price is like a laptop. you can buy a good laptop at this price. if it comes between 30-35 k this phone can be said ok. but now we have to say this phone has only big name but not big features. so i suggestyou all not to buy this phone. if you want to waste your money so you can buy!!!!!!!!!!</text>

    <text>my first iphone was iphone 4 i really loved it especially the ios side which i found simple to use. before i had a samsung galaxy i9000 which wasnt really good as the battery life was terrible so i decided to upgrade to iphone 4 and i have had it for about almost 2 years. few days ago i decided to upgrade to iphone 5 and i have to say its the most amazing phone i have ever used, which remains simple  and straight forward to use a really great device by apple. if you want a simple yet superior mobile experience i would highly recommend buying an iphone 5. i really love ios on the phone its what makes the phone i wasnt bothered going for a high end android like galaxy note 2 with quad core still i think iphones beats them all yet only having a dual core cpu its amazing how technology has advanced.</text>

    <text>hi sahil, i got myself iphone5 just last week, and also have sgn2 too. sgn 2 is used by my dad, but i have used sgn many times for surfing and checking up different apps. and let me tell u that sgn's battery is a tank, i guess as u have it u may have an idea. i  bought iphone 5 only because i had invested a lot in apple ecosystem (ipad, mac). i have used 4 &amp; 4s both. the only diff in 4s and five is screen and also it's light. speed in not a much diff in 4s and 5. i was badly waiting for next gen android 1080p screens and bb10 but couldn't wait longer. and i think in 3-4 months when these will be out iph5 will be kinda old thing. if battery is a concerned then its nothing in front of sgn2 &amp; and screen ( only drawback sgn has is the green tone in browser ). apps always better in apple,  and  as far status is concerned apple does performs in that field also. everybody notices it.  so only if u are heavily invested in apple apps or concerned about status symbol then only go for iph5 otherwise sgn 2 performs many tasks easily.</text>

    <text>i agree. just look at android. i believe some of their apps crashes because there's a bunch of phones that needs to be supported. different brands, chipset, screen size, ram, etc. unlike with iphone the developers only to need to focus on apple products in which they are very familiar of.</text>

    <text>its an ok phone. if you liked the iphones 4 and 4s you'll definitly like this one, since its basicly the same phone with a 4 inch screen.  honnestly, i'll gladly sell this phone to my grandma or something like that, i'd never buy one for myself, not because its a bad phone, mostly because its not good enough. the only great thing about apple is that their os is pretty stable..  anyway, around 5/10 for me</text>

    <text>hi, i'm using iphone5 (32gb,white) since a week now, earlier was using iphone 4s. after reading all reviews, wud say i find battery back-up is same as i use to get from 4s with my 56apps. 1-2 times a day i've to charge this device. about scratches, yes iphone 5 seems to be prone to scratches if not handled properly, just like 4s' glass front &amp; rear panels can get cracked if not handled with care. so i dont find any more risk in using iphone5 if compared to its earlier versions. still ip5 gives u very nice feeling than 4s, as it is very lite, sleek &amp; fast. its best smartfone in market as of now. iphone always needs care, infact all smartfones needs care &amp; brain to run it hassle free with better battery back-up. thanx for reading.</text>

    <text>is it only me or a general feeling that iphone5 battery drains really fast. just bought ip5 32 gb for rs 52.5 k ( 954 $ approx). really exp here in india. and now after using it for some hours i m feeling that the battery drains faster than ip4s. have being using iphone since ip4 and now i think ip4 had the best battery, obviously as it had same mah 1424. apple should have really increased the battery as they had increased the screen size. have also got sgn 2 and even though it has a giant screen 5.5 inch. it's battery is a tank 3100 mah. never had to recharge it twice a day. and this i guess will have to atleast 2 times a day.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 battery sucks big time. i am a big apple fan, but now after spending so much on iph5 (950 $).  i think i made a big mistake. should have waited for next one or androids with 1080p with battery like 3100 mah ( may be note 3). just can't realise that apple being such a big company, can't they just think that with same battery and a bigger screen the phone will run less. totally disappointed on 5 after using 4,4s.i think i wasted a lot of money on apple. had thy increased the battery to 2000 mah this would have been a better phone.</text>

    <text>i have the iphone 5, and i can say that is no upgrade from the 4s, and i had the 4s! i dont see an significant improvement over the 4s, as the 4s was snappier anyway, i dont like the 5, because it puts all my applications in 4's box style, the only thing which works is the video, aesthetically this has very minor improvement over the 4s, and the 4s is 80% of iphone 5, games are not optimized for iphone 5, and you may get the letter box effect, only a handful of games support iphone's 4 inch resolution, 85% doesnt, might as well wait till the next iphone if you want to upgrade! i am planning to return it back to the store, which i paid $650</text>

    <text>firstly, i always research phones extensively before upgrading. i am not knocking samsung or htc or motorola for their hardware, but android is crap. i have 4 friends with galaxy s3's and it doesn't take long for the phone to become slower and less responsive. scrolling through a picture library feels like something is holding it back.i have the iphone 5 16gb. no matter how many apps are open in the background, everything simply works instantly. no lagging whatsoever. it just works. no need to reboot every couple of days like android. apple is more stable and more efficient than any android i've seen up to date. like i said, nothing wrong with the hardware....android is the problem. unfortunately the general public seems to like the extra &quot;fancyness&quot; of android, but the simple, sleek operation, look and feel of ios is so much more efficient. so much so, that the iphone 5, with slower cpu seems to outperform the androids my far. bigger isn't always better. if you want a big screen, get a tablet. if you want a trouble free smartphone experience, get an iphone.</text>

    <text>hi guys, i've used galaxy s3 for last three months. no doubt it's a great phone but since last 4 days when i decided to switch to iphone 5, i am very satisfied that i've made a right decision. iphone 5 is no doubt a bit expensive but it has its own class. smooth and easy to use and quick too. battery life is same as s3 as i've experienced. but the main difference seen in apps. applications running in ios are far better than android. i can't say it's developers fault or android doesn't has capability to run them properly. but finally i am enjoying the apple's product. which i haven't experienced before. thanks</text>

    <text>warning dont upgrade to ios 6.0.2...  this is a warning to all please dont download ios 6.0.2 for your devices.. i have an iphone 5 and my friend has an ipad mini.. and the battery doesn't stand 5 hours a day off the charger after the update.. this is one of the worst experiences i cam across with apple.. i want to downgrade to 6.0 but itunes wont allow as it can void my warranty... really this is the worst update from apple.. and they call this an update? fixed the wireless issues and screw up the battery life..  i am an iphone fan.. but now my eyebrow is raising at what apple has become in terms of credibility..  i repeat donot upgrade to 6.0.2 till a fix is released or you will regret it you have been warned..</text>

    <text>up until just a month ago.  i never owned an iphone i never owned any android phones  in fact i never used owned any smart phones before.  i had a nokia x3-02 so as you know, i do not know the history of how much android or the ios evolved.  i know windows is very new.  i was only able to play around with these phones by playing with my friends devices.   most of my friends own an ip4 or the ip4s.  alot own the s3.  i can't   have a bunch of co workers owning the s3.  i only know a few friends who own the ip5.  my sister owns a windows phone.  after months of sampling them ios and android through tablets and phones, or whenever i walk by my local apple store at metrotown, i can tell you right now, the ios to me comes out on top.  it's just so smooth and simple.  quality build is top notch compared to the s3.  not impressed with that phone as they considered it samsung muscle phone.  sure as hell doesn't compare to the ip5 in quality build.  no f in way.   please don't tell me other wise.  the ip5 is wonderfully built.  i did really enjoy using the note 2.  really did.  no joke.  very nice phone.  but much to big.   windows phone.  very good.  very easy to use.  however ios is the best all around ios on the planet.  by far.  sorry fandroids, but just speaking the truth.  i got a 4s for christmas, and love it to death.  sure it will be nice for a bigger screen. again, i won't be fully biased.  apple needs a bigger screen, but in the end, ip4s works great for me.</text>

    <text>i've used 4 , 4s , 5 , note , note 2 , lg nexus 4 and this what i have to say .  &quot;iphone is ferrari and  android phones are hyundai&quot;  you just can't compare it !   had to replace battery of my note in 7 months , same happened with my friends , i still have 3gs and battery is just like it used to be ... if you are ready to compromise quality then go to android , &amp; when i said quality , i meant both hardware and software  .  basically what attractive about android phones from users perspective is , large &amp; colorful display and smacking hardware specifications . trust me android phones are snappy only when they're new , after installing applications it crawls, feels so laggy and least but not least you'll get horrible battery life (keep searching and troubleshooting for those culprit apps) .  memory management is pathetic in android which results in horrible lag &amp; low battery life . everyone knows that ui and application quality in ios in way way way smother than android , the good thing about android is its openness !  when is comes to customization , yes android has upper hand but a jailbroken iphone provides even better customization .  lastly , i'm not an apple fanboy if i were then i wouldn't have wasted so much money trying android phones . i'll stick to ios for now as it suits me best but hopefully my next stop will be ubuntu mobile os , looks promising !  whats the use of 2gb ram , 1.5 ghz quad core when it can't beat 1gb ram , 1.2ghz dual core ?</text>

    <text>why do we humans always like to compare ? everybody has their own preference. some like a bigger screen while others prefer a slim and compact phone. i am using a note 2 and my darling loves the iphone5. to her iphone5 is a beauty,the screen display is the best and so is it's slim and beautiful body. this i totally agree. for me the note 2 is a 2 in 1 device.if you loves to watch video than note 2 is the best choice.the 5.5&quot; screen is just nice not too small to tired my eyes not too big to put in my pocket or answer phone calls. so both are great phones.</text>

    <text>&quot;and believe me or not, but after having configured my nexus 4 just the way i always wanted  providing me with the fastest access to my most frequently used apps along with the most important information on a single screen  whenever i grab my iphone for testing purposes, ios feels pretty old, outdated and less user friendly.for me, there currently is no way of going back. once you get used to all of these capabilities, its hard to live without them.&quot;</text>

    <text>screen is bit small. every user goes for big and high resolution screen. in the mean time, battery durability should be improved. improving this two conditions will put ip5 into perfection. other specs r quite perfect.</text>

    <text>i've first tested my sisters windows phone. constantly testing out my friends android phones s3 and note 2's. got the ip4s for christmas . i'm going to tell you guys in a non biases point of view the ios is the best operating system on the planet. by far. i am in asia right now and people praise iphones non stop. the ones that use android phones wish they had an iphone.  the only weakness to the newest iphone is that the screen is no longer big enough.  but the phone works wonderfully. it's just amazing phone. haters will hate but the iphone5 is the probably the  a top 2 smart phone on the planet. i'm not even sure why the s3 is in the same sentence as the ip5. i've been using my 4s for a good 3 weeks now and i have nothing but good things to say about it. now i know why iphone users are so defensive, as they should be. there is nothing wrong with the ip5. but one thing for sure. they do need a bigger screen.</text>

    <text>depth (mm)   weight (g)   volume (in)  when we envisioned the new iphone, we landed on a remarkably thin and light design. but its nearly impossible to make a device so thin and so light without sacrificing features or performance.  we could have taken the easy way out and designed something more reasonable and less remarkable. but we didnt. if the technology didnt exist, we invented it. if a component wasnt small enough, we re-imagined it. if convention was standing in the way, we left it behind. the result is iphone 5: the thinnest, lightest, fastest iphone ever.  iphone 5 is just 7.6 millimeters thin. to make that happen, apple engineers had to think small, component by component. they created a nano-sim card, which is 44 percent smaller than a micro-sim. they also developed a unique cellular solution for iphone 5. the conventional approach to building lte into a world phone uses two chips  one for voice, one for data. on iphone 5, both are on a single chip. the intelligent, reversible lightning connector is 80 percent smaller than the 30-pin connector. the 8mp isight camera has even more features  like panorama and dynamic low-light mode  yet its 25 percent smaller. and the new a6 chip is up to 2x faster than the a5 chip but 22 percent smaller. even with so much inside, iphone 5 is 20 percent lighter and 18 percent thinner than iphone 4s.    making a thinner, lighter iphone meant even the display had to be thinner. apple engineers accomplished that by creating the first retina display with integrated touch technology. which means instead of a separate layer of touch electrodes between display pixels, the pixels do double duty  acting as touch-sensing electrodes while displaying the image at the same time. with one less layer between you and what you see on iphone 5, you experience more clarity than ever before. all on a display thats 30 percent thinner than before.</text>

    <text>for sure not the most technical high end phone, but you do not need to buy the iphone 5 because of its super specs. look to it, hold it.... it is passion, beauty, it is super, outstanding. samsung is better, ok , but better in what ? making plastic boxes ? put the iphone 5 on the table, it looks like a juwel compared to the s3, who cares about super specs nobody is using. iphone 5 is pure and for sure the most attractive phone on the market</text>

    <text>i recently sold my note 2 and purchased iphone 5. i hope this explain you which one is better. both the os's have apps, games etc but the thing android sucks at is battery.  i sold my 4s and upgrade to note ii considering that massive 3100mah battery will last a day for a traveler like me, but it was completely opposite.  i have tried custom roms, stock deodexed roms, custom kernels, removed all bloatwares from samsung douchwiz, but still it didn't last a day for me. average screen time was 5-6 hours on note ii which would be the best if you compare it with sgs2, sgs3 and hox.  compare the same with iphone 5, right now my battery is 56% with screen time of 5hours 43mins, 15 hours standby. it gonna last more than a day.  same apps, same social bunch of apps like facebook, whatsapp, twitter, instagram which i installed in note ii.  now, decide yourself. either enjoy massive screen, huge custom roms, customizations, custom kernels, tons of launchers and suck battery life for 10-15 hours.  or enjoy closed os, no customization, no different launchers, no jailbreak (iphone 5/ios6), amazing battery life of 1-2 days.  make your choice!</text>

    <text>i had an iphone 3gs for 2 years then got a 4s, wasn't that bad but having to jailbreak to be able to slightly customize the os/ui was anything but a great user experience. and the hardware lacked the power to do gaming/hd video/flash or decent webbrowsing. the only thing that had speed comparable to a high end android phone was the ui speed when nothing was running in the background. i have switched to an att samsung captivate glide (galaxy s2 variant with physical keyboard) with a tegra 2 processor/gpu overclocked to 410 mhz for gaming/cpu overclocked to 1400mhz/great battery life/1 gb ram and rom (was only $120 off contract and unlockable with an app in the google play store for free). i had an iphone but after switching to android i will never switch back.  p.s: not bashing anything or anyone, just an old iphone user sharing my experience is all.</text>

    <text>infact each person has his own choice of phone, so please use this site to write the positive and negative things you see in your phone, so others too can learn something new and share something!! this is not a place to insult and condemn each other!! its sad that gsm arena reviews are mostly by uneducated and the common blue collar worked!! this place is for decent people and not hooligans!</text>

    <text>i'm overly satisfied with my white iphone 5 which i purchased last dec 23, im here in the philippines. smooth menu, blazing fast intrnet connction(even not 4g lte yet) via 3g. looks good, and feel good too holding in my hands. the only problem i have is the battery life, using 3g and data services on, it only lasts for max of 6 hours and it heats too much....:( do you feel the same on your phone???</text>

    <text>yeah i totally agree! iphone 5 is way better than s3 or note 2... simply because an iphone is an iphone...  i knew someone who was scammed and had bought a clone s3... the phone really looked like s3 and performed like s3... the bad thing about androids is that it is an open system... if u have the same hardware then u can install android on it unlike apple which is a closed system.. yah, there are iphone 5 clones but you can never see an exact copy! and those clones run android!  apple is all quality, from its hardware to its software.. i have used an s3 before, yeah its quadcore but it is pretty crappy and hangs a lot more than the iphone 5...</text>

    <text>being that i work for a cell operator mvno, generally we are pretty psyched about new apple kit as it gives us an opportunity to swag more custom as we already have an edge on pricing. however the issues we have experienced with the iphone 5 and ios 6 are pretty criminal. in terms of hardware there appears to be a known(by apple) fault on sim contacts which they immediately swap handsets out for without commenting, plus the software keeps resetting the apns to carrier default which is pretty rubbish if you are an mvno. as ever apple demonstrate a lack of build quality on important components and a cavalier attitude towards smaller networks. nice one!</text>

    <text>iphone has good standby battery because they have controlled multi-tasking.  they only allow these basic process running in the background for apps: 1. voip (etc.. viber) 2. apple push notification 3. audio / one instance only. (no overlap from different apps) 4. airplay  all other multi-task will be forced to terminate in 30 secs or so once app terminate or standby.  while android allows all multi-task to go on even without user's permission. plus each app have to implement their own push notification (compared to just one from apple)... all of which is very stressful on the phone's radio (wifi/3g/4g etc). they also retain all recent apps in memory, which might use internet connection as well.. but this allows very fast app launches.</text>

    <text>but what i dont like about the iphone 5 is the os just feels too boring now. the os is purely made up of nothing but icons. you can't multi task like on the gs3 or xperia s where you can have a window open while browsing the web. there are no animations or live backgrounds with multi screens buzzing. i think most iphone 5 users would be atleast agreable that a new os with somewhat of quite a radical change from the current ios one is due.</text>

    <text>i've already posted this. my daughter's iphone5 lasts 5 days with normal use (no gaming) and over a day of heavy use. i have a screenshots to prove it. if you gimme an email i can send them to you. give it some 10 full cycles of battery full fill-drain 2% to 100% and back to 2% and so on. you will see the difference in about two weeks. it has better battery then samsung galaxy 2 or 3 and sony xperia s. however, 4s is somewhat better (perhaps due to a smaller screen).</text>

    <text>use top phones of 2012. iphone 5, s3  iphone is standby friendly, anything can be shutdown or put on standby very quickly without affecting battery and you have no nagging feeling you forgot to do something on your phone.  s3 comes with alot of features and full-multitasking, allow you to tweak your device to your liking, but the additional features and full multi-tasking comes with a price, when you put your phone on standby, it might not be fully sleeping and might waste battery if you do not want it. it requires more attention on the device.  both good phones nevertheless..</text>

    <text>trouble with apple iphone is u have to be prepared to buy every bit of media content you puton it. video music films all have to be paid for like 5 songs will cost you five bucks wtf. i have hundred oc songs on my android fone look how much thay would have cost me if i was running a iphone 5. secondly iphone 5 is the same design as iphone 4 but longer that look is startinv to look old relic like plus iphone 5 looks ugly because igs a streched iphone 4. if acfually looks like a old 3gs because it looks more curvey. now lets not kid ourselvez the iphone os is looking out dated when compared to ics and jelly been. everything is static and basic on iphone os you cant change anything. igs the same os apple have been using since the first iphone just extremely small changes. now the iphone 5 is not techni al enough there is no high end features found on high end android phones you cant even tv ouf via hdmi wtf? and this is like a 665 way too much</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is the successor of the iphone 4s. for many, the iphone 5 may be the best gadget out there. but if you look closely, it's not as good as you think. first of all, the iphone 5 is extremely expensive. the iphone 5 tear down suggests that it would take apple only around 178$ to manufacture one iphone 5. from there we can get a idea how expensive apple have tagged their products with. most of all, iphone 5 lacks flexibility. although iphone 5 is powered by bluetooth 4.0, you can't do basic thing like transfer file from one device to another. you still have to be dependentupon itunes for file transfer. the user interface looks dull and boring as it always looked. the still aren't home screens to swype through. the notification bar doesn't give you quick access to settings. you have to go through a hefty process just to change your ring tone. although apple has finally increased the size of iphone to 4 inch, that may not be enough for hard core smartphone users . at least, a 4.3 inch screen would have done the job. though the screen size has been increased all the apps from the apple store are not optimized for iphone 5. so, we see back empty spaces in many of the applications. apple decided to remove google maps and that was one of their main mistake. google maps is the bestnavigationsoftware so far. like the iphone 4s, iphone 5 has most of it's part made of glass. if you drop it once, don't be surprised if a part of the phone is cracked. some people say why not keep protection cover but if you keep it, what's the point of having such glossy back?the iphone 5 also lacks support of micro-sd card. that means you can't expand your device as per your wish. the 32gb and 64gb iphone are terribly expensive. while a 32 gb micro-sd card only costs about 20$, if you want to have a 32gb iphone instead of 16gb, you will have to pay 100$ more just for 16gb extra storage. further, iphone 5 lacks removable battery option which means no third party powerful battery like mugen batteries. if you travel a tot, you won't be able to carry spare battery due to closed battery cover. in addition to that, the battery life of iphone 5 isn't that good either. you use a lot of application, then be sure that it won't even last for a day or so. iphone 5 is no huge leap over iphone 4s with most of the things kept same.most of all, apple's decision to remove google maps was a blunder. apple maps is nowhere near google maps is full of error.you won't get street view feature either.don't be fooled and never go after apple. be smart and chose smartphone that best suits you!honestly, if you don't go for brand name, iphone just isn't the device for you. keep all the things i said in mind and you will neverregret. stay tuned and stay updated! do like, post comment and follow me. thank you for reading my post.</text>

    <text>if you want to go for the bigger screen of gs3...wow. it is still too small to edit files or do things that can be done on pc or tablet. therefore, if you need bigger screen for such activities....get yourself a tablet or mini tablet. phones, even the 4,8 inch screens, are too small to do these things.....the difference between 4 inch and 4,8 inch....too small diff to make it an issue. you wont even notice or feel it!! you wont feel that it is more comfortable as is set out on forums and reviews...same with speeds.....that diff is so small...</text>

    <text>as much as i wanted to stay away from apple i must say they have won me over with the iphone 5. im a big android fan but most phones now are just too big for me. im a big 6 foot guy but the latest android offerings don't work for me. 4.3 inches was great while it lasted but 4.6-5.5inches are to big for me. why?... i like having an all in one device. the iphone 5 size proves to be and do just that. i love running and the iphone 5 does not get in the way of that. i can carry it with me on my runs without feeling like i'm carrying a break on me. thank you apple and i look forward to all your future offerings.</text>

    <text>today i experience the sync to icloud again! amazing! easy! contacts, mail, notes,reminders, calendar! if you open icloud on pc (i got dell laptop), everything is there. one entry on iphone, ipad or icloud is automatically pushed to all devices. calendar is my favorit, as in my business about 80% of my entries on phone! reminders and notes! it can all be done by all platforms, but apple is the easier one. one should experience to understand. icon on calendar is the exact date....it changes date and day everyday. not just an icon. all other phones i have seen is just an icon. it's all these little things that add up. wifi is switched of when phone is locked. same with whatsupp. and so all apps. that is the reason that the small battery is performing that good. all phones are good, but iphone just got that little bit special!</text>

    <text>i'm a total cell phone newbie; esp when it comes to the latest smart phones. i've been thinking of upgrading my older verizon cell phone (i have basic verizon cell phone service now, in rural sc) to one that could be used on 4g locally and also internationally when i go to europe next summer. i need to be able to send and receive text messages to/from my wife, and also to be able to call from some place in europe to some other place in europe occasionally. i also want to be able to go online and check email, maybe use a train timetable app once in a while, etc.  i know what it means to buy a &quot;quad band unlocked&quot; phone. i know that i can buy prepaid cell phones and/or sim cards as i travel around europe.  but i am also interested in just what international capabilities i'd be buying, if any, if i buy an iphone5 here in the us instead.  when i visited my local verizon store, the sales guy told me that the iphone5 is a true international phone. using the list of stuff i've given above as the list of stuff i want to be able to do, my question is: is he right, or is he blowing smoke at me!?  i am aware there are many other issues at work here in deciding what to upgrade to, what plans to sign up for, etc. right now, what i want to know is: if i buy an iphone5, am i buying a cell phone i can use the way i want to once i'm in europe and could my wife use her basic cell phone from the us to call and text me while i'm there?</text>

    <text>while the samsung fanboys keep on defending, read what the samsung chief strategy officer uses:    from the interview:  &quot;i use a mac, actually, at home. i've always used mac, an iphone, and an ipad... at work i'm using samsung devices; apple at home, mainly because all of my systems and files are done that way. that's sticky, you know?&quot;  game over!</text>

    <text>i own ip5 and galaxys3 lte. the size of the gs3 is uncomfortable. maybe my hands are too small. the ip5 is very easy and can be operated with one hand. integration with icloud is superb and also with ipad. both are great phones, but for normal use, ip5 is just easier and more professional and rounded off. google maps with voice turn by turn navigation is now available for free and is working 100%!</text>

    <text>hi, i hope you welcome samsung fans who have something good to say about apple ....  i just discovered that iphone 5 is amazing! some of you may say,i knew that but the amazing thing is the new cover battery backup for ip5....2000mah battery extension on a classy and thin back cover with a kick stand. that means you get a total of 3400mah to run ip5 and that gives you something like 120 hours of endurance...  the cost is more than friendly, 34...only and takes for hours to charge the back up....beautiful beautiful...  good bye samsung note...2500mah battery gives me 8 hours of endurance and a lot of over heating. thanx for a bumpy sketchy ride...cheap is really expensive.</text>

    <text>hi guys , i got an iphone 5 and samsung galaxy s2 as well. in case you love to play games and hate force closing thn its just iphone 5 . you get one installation file for iphone 5 whereas in case of android you get abasic set up and got to download the rest of data that really pisses  off the user. in case you like screen size and watching videos then android is fine. for using iphone to best of its capacity you got have all the knowledge of jb nad restoring otherwise you are good for android only</text>

    <text>hi ppl. need ur opinion. i am planning to buy a new phone.. m a bit confused between iphone 5 and samsung galaxy s3. currently i am using galaxy i9003 since 2 yrs. my phone keeps hanging on a regular basis. i am assuming this could be due to the android os or may be i  use internet heavily on my phone,use a lot of bluetooth to transfer files, watch movies on my phone. is it because of the heavy ram useage my phone hangs? i have heard that iphone has the below limitations:- a. no bluetooth facility to transfer files.so, any alternative to do so? b. iphone 5 does not support all video formats?.so, does it have an application that runs all formats?  i have seen few ppl carrying an s3 who are recent purchasers of the phone. and they love it. i have also seen ppl who regret buying a s3,simply coz it hangs plz help</text>

    <text>not true. i've got sony xperia s, my daughter iphone5 and my wife 4s. by far best battery is on 4s, while iphone 5 lasts 5 days with moderate use (wifi and bluetooth on). xperia s lasts up to 3 days with wifi and bluetooth off and just under a day when they are on. htc and samsung galaxy 2s that are owned by my brother in law and my cousin also last about a day (on a good day). so, iphone5 is pretty much at the top in terms of battery juice among modern smartphones.</text>

    <text>just brought a iphone5 64gb last week, so thin &amp; light, looks like a piece of jewellery, the retina display is clear &amp; so easy to read, copied some 720p hdtv shows to it &amp; played them perfectly. connected to my wifi in seconds without any problems, scrolling thru the menus is fast &amp; smooth, ios 6 took me a little time to get my head around the closed os, but am getting to terms with it quickly. most of my friends have android phones, lg optimus black, samsung galaxy s3, sony xperia neo, compared to the iphone5 these phones have a plastic toy feel to them, not saying these roid phones a rubbish, but the finishing of the iphone5 is a++. some people have had chipping paint problems with their iphone5's but my white one is still in perfect condition. the phone was quite expensive but am very happy with my purchase.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 great built design, easy to use ios, bundle of apps, but the price for apple &quot;ecosystem&quot; is way too expensive. just think about how much you have spend for the last 2 years on your iphone ie: apps, upgrade, accessories ect... nice marketing by apple!</text>

    <text>iphone five looks good is built ok, and is for airheads, blu tooth implementation is unworkable, contacts management is a disaster. telephone calling is equal to symbian 10 years ago. do not be succered into buying one if you actually do use your phone. it simply does not perform.</text>

    <text>i think apple is different than other mobile companies. it doesn't tries to compete with others although a quad-core was released it still kept a dual core on i5. the best user experience from my view is the quality, briskness, agility, beauty, simplicity,... makes a device better in user experience when compared to others devices. i5/any_apple_device is not here to compete but to create a world of its own. although the other phones are seriously better but i would still prefer this.</text>

    <text>you know what guys, i don't really care if you're using an apple or android. i guess you just don't need to argue because your choice of phone depends on your needs and wants. everyone wants something that might be different from yours so basically there's nothing to argue about since we are not all on the same shoes, wants and whatnot. if you're a driod fan, so enjoy...if you think apple can suit your needs/wants, then enjoy - - - that's it.</text>

    <text>anyway just an observer, and enjoyer of gadgets. ios needs to offer a cheaper iphone model to strengthen its position, android needs to unify its os and solve its upgrade path as well as fragmentation issues.  rumor is that apple will introduce an affordable in 2014, i wish they would do that next year instead. android has made good improvements in jelly bean but with majority on gingerbread, the improvements are not felt by most android users.  meanwhile, microsoft is pushing wp8 hard and making good moves.</text>

    <text>i've had this phone for a little while now and it really is a fantastic phone! it's the little touches within the ios that really set it apart from the android crew (my gs3 was awful and i couldn't get rid of it quick enough if i'm honest!).. touches like (this seems to be little - known as well!) when you plug the apple ear pods in, listen with those and plug another pair of generic earphones in the iphone remembers the volume that was last set with the respective pair - sounds insignificant but it just adds to the ease and joy this phone is to use!</text>

    <text>for starters, if &quot;user experience&quot; is paramount then it should be tested as such simply because i didn't need my ip5 to overheat and shut down when i needed the gps feature while driving in alberta for work. i also didn't need my ip5 to crash the one time i needed to make an emergency call by pressing the &quot;emerg call&quot; button to report a drunk driver... oh, and this procedure to open phone.app/contacts/scroll to make a call is outdated. did anyone mention battery life? now you have 3 new examples from an actual ip5 user that says for what you get it's overpriced.</text>

    <text>woot iphone and ipad are steamrolling the competition. wow!  &quot;apple's tablet &quot;generated more traffic than any other tablet or smartphone, reaching nearly 10 percent of online shopping,&quot; according to ibm's report. the next device in line was the iphone, with 8.7% of shopping traffic, then all androd devices combined with 5.5% of traffic. the ipad's 10% slice of mobile retail translates to a whopping 88.3% of tablet shopping traffic, with the nook, kindle and samsung galaxy tablets all eking out shares of 3% or less.&quot;</text>

    <text>depends what you want the phone to do because iphone is very limited depending on what you doing, and i wouldn't waste your money on the htc one x because it has very poor battery life and no external memory or replaceable battery so go for galaxy s3 if you want something that size.</text>

    <text>ios isn't written better than android it's just the fact it has to do a lot less, so making android look like it runs as fast as ios is much, much harder to do, and if you try a s3 or note 2 running jellybean you'll see it's almost as fast and smooth even though they running on fairly old cpu architecture.</text>

    <text>the iphone1 is basically the pioneer of all smart phones.  true it wasn't the first kind of it's phone, the badly terribly produced &quot;pda&quot; was kind of it's first, however that ended up bad, and eventually kinda faded out on its own.  then came apple, who decided to see what they can do, with a phone, and bam instinct success.  their smartphone was the very first one to be extremely successful.  google decided to do the same thing and programed, the highly glitched android, who to this day, still have many problems, in fact jellybean 4.2 has more problems then the previous jellybean.  then lg, samsung etc etc decided to make their own flat screen keyless phone that is somewhat similar to what the iphone does but on a glitched android os. i guess for you, you definely should stick with android.  to me, a phone is a phone.  it's a not a computer to me. computer needs multi tasking.   a phone shouldn't be multi tasking as in the past, phones barely mult tasked.  that being said if thats what you want, then go for a android phone.  apple makes their products priortize important.   how often is someone doing 2 things at once, on a phone???  the fandroid counter argument is, &quot;many many many&quot; for the sake of arguing, even though most of the time we are probably doing only one thing at once.  it be nice for ip5 to have multi tasking, but to me its on of those things that is not necessary important. it's just fanroids continue to use the &quot;it can multi task&quot; multi task = battery kill.  yes, it kills your battery.  network sharing. there is network sharing on the iphone.  not sure what crack your smoking.  the customzed main screen is a really cool feature, something i can also live without.  you guys are really bickering about a really small thing, that is not realy important.  if it means that much, then a stupid android phone and stay the hell away from this forum, as fandroids has already forced gsm arena into reviewing posts before it gets posted already.  a survey conducted to 4400 ip5 users, 92% say the new ios map is good.  3% had a problem with it, the rest said it was somewhat of a problem.  but google map is now back on the ios6, so no point arguing about maps.  anyways, you see tech reviews, of the ip5.  google it.  theres a reason why almost every ip5 review is such a high review.  because it functions well, they don't review stuff like that &quot;widgets&quot; and crap like that, as stuff like that doesn't determine, the quality, the usability and overall function of the phone.  also tech experts and program developers already know the ios is a superior and &quot;mastered&quot; os to the android as android is still having problems.  i know 2 different friends who work as developers both, of them tell me, developers focus more on ios, becuase its easier, and in the end, the app runs much better on the ios vs android.  now i'm going to make a comment based on android if android was created by apple.   this is what haters will say if apple made the android.  &quot;i'm sorry apple, but your new os is garbage.  there are so many glitches,  i keep dropping calls, and sometimes my phone power cycles.  something your old os never had a problem with.  also it's not as smooth, and the most important part, internet processing is slow.  another problem is your app library sucks now.  what happened to all those cool apps and games you guys use to have?  i know multi tasking is cool, but i think your new os, is killing the battery life, as my phone drains the battery quickly.  also your display is not as good as before.  doesn't look as nice! bring back your retina!!! you are saying you have 1080hd screen, but it still not as good as the ios6! wth apple! also when the hell are you going to let me update to the jelly bean 4.2! i've been waiting for 2 months! wth! it's right there. let me update it!  also you allowing other companies to use your o.s, there is inconsistencies running your o.s.! wth does that phone can update to your latest version jelly bean by mine cant bring back your old o.s, or else i'm going straight to nokia lumia! &quot;  this is what apple hater will probably say if apple made android.  the ip5 right now is probably one of the best smart phones out there.  tech reviews don't lie, even gsm arena gave it a good review.  better o.s, better quality build, better apps, better display then the s3.  it really is.  also, in canada, if you want an ip5, you have to wait 2 weeks.  demand is very high for this phone.  it really is one of the best phones on the planet. there isn't really an equivalent android phone out there on the planet.  great phone.  2 thumbs up.  fandroids keep complaining about apple.  how they say apple knows people will buy their stuff no matter what, and apple fan boys knows this too, that even if apple had all those features of the jelly bean, they wont buy their stuff because theres an apple logo on it. same thing.</text>

    <text>it is because the ios software is so well written that it doesn't need faster cpu or many cores to run faster. i am not a applefanboy(i own a galaxy s2),but it is true. android os is slightly downward and that's why it needs faster cpu and more cores to run smoother. in real life performance the iphone 5 feels realy smooth than other androids. but androids are catching up faster and i am willing to see it running fore fluid than iphone.</text>

    <text>i don't think so if this phone is faster than on any other phones because iphone 5 has a 1.2ghz cpu...but the galaxy s3 has a quad-core 1.4 ghz cortex-a9 cpu.. however they always emphasized that iphone5 is faster when it comes to a processor...</text>

    <text>okay so i came here to see if anyone had any problems or opinions on the iphone 5. but no, its full of apple to android war. so i could be professorial and just leave it at that but id rather join in... okay so going to start with that hands down no one can argue that the iphone and samsung galaxy series are the best phones on the market. and either way they are both great choices. i will admit that the iphone is missing features that could have easily added, most of the apple junkies will deny it but guess what its the truth. samsung with android can do just about anything you'd want in a smartphone. i personally love android, i am very techy, love the freedom and have wanted a s3 since prerelease rumors. but im as of now planning on getting the iphone for one reason, the fact that it just works. apple has really nailed that hardware software fluidity. android does (dont lie to yourself) have slightly less reliability rate, it glitches, lags, etc. it is defiantly not as bad past versions of android but i have had enough fiddling to get things to work, flashing, re-installing, and 6 week warranty repair trips. i at this point just want easy use, simplicity, reliability, and portability (there's an app for that...) and that is what the iphone has been good at for years.</text>

    <text>another trend i noticed also is that android fanboys used to come in swarms, but now they have dwindled to a handful, one here, one ther. nowhere near the numbers like before, as they have shifted over to ios and wp8 probably.</text>

    <text>in the beginning, people supported android fans, as most were indifferent to apple anyway.  thankfully, with wp8 entering the scene, they have seen how obnoxious android fanboys truly are. every article here on gsmarena, which is ios or wp8 will have some android punk stirring up problems.  they try hard to pretend to be wp8 or ios fans but it usually doesn't stick. only a matter of time now, people are fedup with you guys.</text>

    <text>you know if people buy an apple product and say yeah i like the iphone but i'm fully aware that apple deliberately leaves out features that could seriously make the phone better but doesn't include because they make more money by restricting features then i can totally respect someone who says that. but most of the people who visit the iphone forums like you just keep saying apple sells a lot and refuses to say they wish apple just added something new because just don't want to admit apple's faults.</text>

    <text>why are the gsmarena voting scores so low for the iphone 5 as compared to the iphone 4s? if the voting tallies are not an accurate reflection of a product (or nearly so), then isn't it a bit misleading. i mean, the iphone 5, although not perfect, is not a 6.5-6.7; or is it really that bad?</text>

    <text>if you go back in time, you will find that the reason people hated apple fans was their fanboy loyalty, and cult like mentality where they couldn't even think of using non-apple products.  funny how today, apple fans are simply fans of good tech as can openly discuss using other stuff like wp8 and web android.  the android fanboys however have evolved to be the very brainwashed that they insult lol.  open your mind guys, free yourself from your cage. there is a world beyond your precious android, as well as your tiny bedroom lol.</text>

    <text>on it's own the iphone 5 is a reasonable enough phone but it gets low votes because compared to 4s it just has a bit more power and a tiny bit more screen, and the way most people use it it barely feels like it's improved at all, so people give it low scores because apple just didn't bother to give people anything new while top end androids and windows phones have stepped up into the next generation of phones.</text>

    <text>let's face it. phones these days are no longer used only for calling and texting. majority of its use is web browsing and gaming. having at tiny screen is uncomfortable to the eyes if used for long periods. so, android phones with big screen has a clear advantage.</text>

    <text>india user review:- its light, slim and handy. if you have iphone4s you may not need iphone5. but if you have earliers models then definitely a reason to buy.even dealers are offering emis.  maps: apple is improving maps as per tuaw. also for india mapmyindia in tie up with sygic offers best map experience with door2door navigation, real time traffic updates. google reportedly readies maps app for ios.  don't worry about software glitches. they will be fixed any time through upgrades. still its more better quality than android.  additional features: imessage, camera panorama view, face-time....  iphone5 is bit high priced but not too high if you consider the quality and services like icloud. icloud will give better experience than free drop box.  galaxy s3 is available cheaper than iphone but with bulky size, heavy weight and a cheap plastic back cover. sorry to say but this reminds my school days geometric box.quad core processor? you need or your os need? optimizing os is more important than increasing processor. from my view ios gives better usabilty experience than android. to use android fully, one either need to be a techie or need to have prior android experience. ios is still the easiest os then comes windows and finally android the toughest.</text>

    <text>in any case, if i have offended or said the wrong thing i apologise.  my intention truly isn't to hurt, and i myself dislike conflict. i prefer if we can show mutual respect.  lastly, these are just phones at the end of the day. life is too short to be arguing about them, while there are much bigger issues happening in the world right now. choose the phone that serves you best, and enjoy.</text>

    <text>it's important to note that the iphone group has relatively same usage habits in that most utilize their phones quite well. android however have two distinct groups. first group is similar to iphone in that they utilize their phones well, but there is also a second large group who only use it like normal dumbphones.  research now shows how large this group is:</text>

    <text>android is basically a mini pc with all the multitasking, expansion, i/o ports and customisability because it's based on linux so can use terminal emulator which is the equivalent of  windows command line to have full access to change anything where ios is none of that and lacks external sd, otg, and multitasking which gives it the potential capabilities of any pc, and you can deny the truth if you like but iphone is closer to being classed as a toy than a handheld computer. and it means little if iphone potentially has the raw power to do more because hardware is nothing without software and apple only allows anything on there if they can make a profit.</text>

(that's a fact!) 4. it can't share photos, music, videos to other devices unless it is apple. 5. it has the same old boring design. 6. most of all its been f*cking up with you and you don't know it especially if you're a fan boy.  good luck!</text>

    <text>there is no use of just introducing another new iphone with mere simple changes. moreover it is very expensive. most of the apps are paid ones. whereas the same are free for other devices. without memory slot there is no scope for any extra files to store or to view. if internet connection is not available, there is no use of iphone. i advise the company to have a better device which can facilitate the user when internet services are not available. i feel it is just making the users disappointed after buying the new one. before its release a lot of show is created. in the long run, it is just the same.</text>

    <text>i own a galaxy s3 and just bought an iphone 5 3 weeks ago and i will tell u my experience with it.first the design is great and amazingly light and better built than the s3 with higher quality.i didn't see much of a difference in the screen color and resolution of both.but in gaming i have to say this although i like android more the iphone is much smoother in gaming especially in high graphics games such as fifa and need for speed there are absoloutley no lags at all !!! in the s3 it lags from time to time but only in games such as fifa. the camera of the iphone is slightly better but not much of a difference.i used to hate the ios os before but when i tried it i changed my mind. now i am using my iphone as my primary phone but i just cant leave the s3 because of the customization and screen size so its just a matter of taste . u decide which is best</text>

    <text>hahaha! very funny! for your information sg3 comes in not only 16gb storage, there are also 32gb and 64gb sg3. and an additional option of external sd card memory of up to 64gb. putting it together, the 64gb sg3 + 64gb sd card gives you 128gb of space! who needs the useless emojis? it is not that significant. the &quot;force close&quot; you are talking about is not from the unit, it is the defect from the application itselt. it has nothing to do with the performance of the unit. even pc applications and programs experience this thing you are refering to as &quot;force close&quot;. that is why there are softwares and applications updates to get rid of those bugs from the apps.</text>

    <text>i still cant decide if i should buy this phone or not. im kinda waiting/hoping/fearing that apple will come up soon with an iphone5s. like when i bought my iphone3g then the 3gs came out. then when i got my iphone4 the 4s came out.  i ended up buying samsung note 2 which now resides inside my locker as i went back using my iphone.  i dont understand why many people claiming one device is better than the other because of better looking spec sheet. why not just compare the actual performance especially on consistency and connectivity.</text>

    <text>i think the android fanboys need to chill out...  yes the s3 is a great phone, but looks cheap and the design is aweful apple stuck to what works and what people like the iphone 4,4s and 5 all look awesome...  i never used an iphone before the 5 i have always had samsungs but the look of the s2 was so much nicer than the s3, hence i bought the iphone which i feel is much easier to use than the android phones and doesnt lack anything,  the app store is 100% better although you pay for the apps you get the full ad free app, not the half android apps full of ads,  at the enmd of the day they are both phones and its personal opinion having used andropid and ios i will deffinatly be sticking to ios from now on as its a much easier to use system and much more reliable. also iphone looks 1000% better than the s3.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 looks like an incremental upgrade on paper, but once in your hand, only then you realise what a phenomenal upgrade it is. best choice i ever made.  this is simply put, the best smartphone out there, by being the ultimate package and combination of software, hardware, design, performance and efficiency. coupled with the superb app store, it is second to none.  there are phones that can beat iphone on certain individual features, but never together, that's why you need an sgs3 for the screen, the lumia for camera etc, but the single best package?.... iphone 5. no contest.</text>

    <text>it costs around $207 to $238 to create an iphone 5, so by purchasing it we are actually feeding the company itself, not the quality of the phone. i think 4s is still better than iphone 5, as it seems like there are more complaints with the latest iphone.  ps: i heard iphone 5s is just around the corner - 4.5&quot; screen this time?</text>

    <text>as a former samsung user i have seen how both of these phones work.  yes you can do more with the android phones such as personalise them which you cant with apple but at the end of the day they are both just phones.... they are both phones. people buy which ever they prefer i have always used a samsung but bought the ipone 5 and i think its great. yeah yuou pay for apps but you get the full version instead of half versions full of ads... i think everyone here should have a go of both phones before they start making all these stupiud comments that this phones rubbish this ones better....they are all great phones and the only reason people slag them off is because they havnt got one.  not saying thew iphone is the best thing in the world but it is a good phone... so is the galaxy s3 its all personal opinion.. this is a review site not a slagging match...  sort it androiders.  marcus.</text>

    <text>the screen size on this phone is a joke. you get letterboxing when trying to play videos in full screen. no google integration. the maps app is a joke too. you have to pay for most of the good apps on ios. it's like you haven't payed enough for the phone already. the notification bar compared to android jelly bean can't even be compared, and people use that a lot. i have both phones but come on guys, the iphone 5 could have offered so much more. the build quality is great, it's a shame its functionality isn't the same.</text>

    <text>my iphone 5 has been an amazing handheld device that i have used for less than a month. but since i came from a blackberry device, i started missing the keypad from using my blackberry 9780. the iphone is nice and all, but i feel like it's too fragile to hold. so i stuck with my blackberry, hoping one day i will get back the interest of using my iphone 5, which is just on my cabinet, collecting dust.</text>

    <text>its for the people who dont like apple or never been with an apple product. i used to hate apple because it was so costly and i used to think that they priced their product   much more then the real cost. but two years ago i had a wish to use an apple product to try how is it. trust me, my experience change everything. still now i don't like apple as a company but i am using almost every line of their product. i believe android is good but the overall experience is much higher in ios. all the apps are much integrated with the ios. and the apps maker are really conscious about the ios apps then android or windows. and u can get most out of it if u have multiple apple device like iphone, mac and ipad. it all works seamlessly that others don't. finally, u will forget about the money what u have spend when u r using it.</text>

    <text>apple (nasdaqgs: aapl - news) has been criticised for its conduct by senior judges at london's court of appeal.  the iphone and ipad maker published &quot;false and misleading&quot; material, sir robin jacob said, adding that bosses showed a &quot;lack of integrity&quot;.  his written statement came after apple was ordered to post a new statement on its website acknowledging it had lost an earlier legal fight with samsung.</text>

    <text>i've been looking to try to balance it out by finding out how many android apps have never been downloaded but just can't find those figures anywhere, but it does look like that 30% of iphone apps that have been downloaded pretty much all of them barring a few are also available on android. but because most android apps are free people will try them out and often find out they good but because you have to pay for most on iphone they never even gonna get chance to find out, so the reality is that android has a huge amount more apps to use which are identical to iphone which means in the real world having more apps is yet another thing iphone users don't have to brag about.</text>

    <text>hsdpa is actually better than 3g... 3.5g if you will,  lte is a lot faster than hsdpa and 3g  i'm with at&amp;t and on hsdpa i get around 6mbps. with lte that would be over 20mbps. still hsdpa is faster than most peoples wifi! so in theory, lte is not worth it because you're going to use it up faster than say 3g or hsdpa because at&amp;t doesn't have unlimited data. what's teh point of having a ferrari when you're limited to using 2 gallons a day? for every extra gallon they'll charge you extra.. so in my opinion lte is not worth it. go for hsdpa or 3g.</text>

    <text>hahahahahaha! this is what apple got for suing.  &quot; the ifone trademark was filed in mexico in 2003, a full four years before apple filed to trademark the iphone. despite the rather obvious priority issue, apple decided to sue ifone in 2009 in an attempt to invalidate the companys name for being too similar to the iphone. the predictable response was a countersuit by ifone, and the court battles have been swinging in ifones favor ever since.  the move could prove costly to apple in more ways than one. in addition to losing the ability to sell devices under the iphone trademark in mexico, ifone is also suing for damages for past infringement, asking for a minimum of 40% of all iphone sales to date in the mexican market. while those numbers arent nearly as large as they are in the u.s., it still would represent a substantial payment. it's not yet clear whether the embargo on using the iphone name will go into effect before sales of the iphone 5 start on friday, or if this will trigger apple to loosen the purse strings to negotiate a settlement with ifone, but given the circumstances it would seem that apple has precious little leverage this time around.&quot;</text>

    <text>just think before purchasing iphone5 .. what is the main feature i am gonna get with having this phone.. only size which is not perfect as its merely little bit taller and not even wider so this ineffective feature deserves this difference in money so simply if you have 4s don't ever upgrade to 5 , just be wise !! apple is falling cause of its limitation in developments &amp; upgrades ..</text>

    <text>iphone 5 not as popular in india as in western countries, however in their indian debut, the iphone 5 pretty much sold outeverywere in india.  we don't know how much they to sell, but hey, it was sold out.   now heres the problem, in ever heard the galaxy note 2 being &quot;sold out&quot; at any magnitute.  you fandoirds, don't mess with apple.  in terms of overall numbers, any 1 model does not even touch the iphone 5, or the equivlanent compeitive device, (10 inch tablent, mini tablet) etc etc.</text>

    <text>i don't see what people are bitching about... the iphone 5 is actually very awesome.. i've only ever bought 2 iphones, i4 and i5 and they're all the f*&amp;%!$ same. but the iphone is already a good phone so there's no need to buy every new damned iphone. i've had something like 12 or 13 android phones and i've loved em all but this one is probably one of my favorites altough the screen change fragmented the applications it's still a great handset.  the one thing that keeps drawing me back to iphone is the retina display, their rgb matrix looks better than pentile hands down and samoled hd still has issues with burn in (my droid razr is burned quite badly)  iphone (in my humble opinion) is the best all around smartphone available though it takes a big hit for the price. i still love my android phones.</text>

    <text>this is my opinion of the iphone 5.  before i get into it, i must point out that i am a samsung and android fanboy, so my opinion is very colored.  so, that my disclaimer is stated, my opinion shall be stated.  i feel that this device is quite beautiful.  who am i kidding, all iphones are beautiful.  that said, there are many things about this device, it's design, and hardware that i don't like.  the weight and thinness of this device make it feel like a toy, and also kind of make it feel cheaper.  the black models coating scratches and scuffs far too easily for a coating of it's type.  and that screen!  dear god, that screen!!!  not only is it not hd (because, if apple's &quot;retina&quot; ambitions are anything to go by, the iphone will never get hd), but it's size is horrible!  i'll admit, i've grown accustomed to large screens, but that 4&quot;, 9:16 aspect ratio screen on that iphone shape that everyone has grown accustomed to in recent years just looks small, strange, and funny.  i cannot, and will never, agree with a screen that small with a 9:16 aspect ratio.  on other devices with 9:16 aspect ratios, they may not be that much bigger than the iphone 5 -- well, they are, but that isn't the point -- but at least the design of the body is done in such a way to so that it actually looks right.  it looks wrong and out of place on the iphone 5.  bad way of implementing it.  now, if only people would stop buying into apple's retina fantasy for the iphone 5 so that it could properly compete on the screen front with its competition.  i don't care if &quot;your eyes can't distinguish individual pixels&quot;, it's still not hd.  plus, going by the fact that most people actually have greater than 20/20 vision, apple's so called retina is bogus.  i hate apple and all of their products, i hate the fact that they are trying to quell competition, but it doesn't mean i don't want them to properly compete in the mobile realm.  if they can actually begin to innovate again, and stop trying to kill competition, they are more than welcome in my books.</text>

    <text>why don't you people understand that it's apple &amp; the rest ? it's not by specifications, but its build quality, hand feeling &amp; design... even if i'm an ifan, i admit that there are other smartphones way better than iphone...  adroid, even if its buggy, it's more customizable &amp; good looking but ios it's more stable &amp; fast as an operating sistem... iphone it's for another class of users by my opinion, and not for those who want 100x processors, 512xx ram, 10000 rezolutions displays, etc, wich i dont know if you even use, and notice any differences other than some +ms in speed. has no sense to talk about display clarity because there are very small differences at a normal eye looking...</text>

    <text>if there wasn't any problems like scratching issues and camera issues and display issues and wifi issues i would prefer this to other phones because of really good specification and it's little and little phone is better necause it's portable and ios is better than android too.because it has many features like clock,great calendar and great facetime and great photobooth and higher speed when you want to capture a photo and higher speed when you want to swith to second camera from primary camera.</text>

    <text>i was planning to buy an iphone 5 here in our country, but after i saw pricetag i change my mind immediately. its mind blowin. .pesos 54,000 ($1,317) for the 64 gb and pesos 43,000 ($1,020) for the 16 gb. . thats way overpriced for a smartphone,even if its the best. . grrr. .i hate apple for making it so expensive. im gonna wait for the lumia 920 or the 820. . it made me angry.</text>

    <text>it's crazy to say iphone is the best because is the first touch screen phone. which is not true but iphone make it more popular.  why people are comparing iphone 5 to the galaxy s3 while the galaxy note 2 is faster and better than both. the razr hd maxx 3300mah have the best battery life than iphone 5 too.  if we need to see things in the way of the first make touch screen is the best than motorola is the best because he makes the first cellphone in the world.</text>

    <text>apple was not the first to make a touch screen phone, however it was the iphone 1 that revolutionized the smart phone.  the first ones were actually garbage, and we don't even know what are the names of those phones.  it was a million times better then the first touch screen phones, so much better those phones cannot even be called a smart phone. iphone put the &quot;smart&quot; in smart phones.</text>

    <text>microsoft is putting all of its might behind wp8, and also hammering android in the process in the courts. manufacturers now have to pay microsoft a licence fee for every android handset they sell, yet they don't need to for wp8 handsets. pretty soon wp8 will be the more attractive proposition.  they cannot say this out loud because android is still very popular, but behind the scenes manufacturers are pushing and hoping that wp8 wins the day. android fanboys would be good to know this.  while all this is happening, iphone will continue its normal route.</text>

    <text>great phone! it's really faster than my 4s and very light and handy. and it looks pretty cool too! works perfect and strong battery life (based on my daily normal usage, calls, sms, and wi-fi browsing). the maps needs an update though. but still works fine. overall i'll give it a 9/10. i strongly recommend this phone. keep it up apple! -to other phone users out there, i suggest you take an overall testing before judging the phones capabilities, not just because it has lower hardware specs doesn't mean that their laggy or slow. it's the other way around! apple really did great with their hw &amp; sw integration. try it yourself and find out!</text>

    <text>being a user of android,rim,windows and ios i have experienced many things. depending on what use you make with your smartphone you will choose the one that suits you best. many of us have used several devices with different software. by using the device daily you can find which smartphone is more comfortable to you. i have to say that i have used all of the devices, and the most simple and easy to use for my daily use is the iphone. also android had and will always have the best free apps on google play. the first smartphone i've used in my entire life that has never lagged is the iphone. other smartphones was quite laggy on several programs. so in my opinion there is no point of saying which phone is better than the other. if the smartphone of your choice makes you happy then you must not care what others think about it.</text>

    <text>cannot believe this phone has the same dual core 1.2ghz processor and 1gb ram of the samsung galaxy s2 which came out ages ago? same 8mp camera too lol.  i have just bought the s2 in the uk for peanuts for what is an incredibly underated piece of technology which also comes with a micro-sd card slot on top of the generous 16gb internal memory. i've just slotted in my 2gb card which was in my old bb which would have just gone to waste had i got an iphone it will take a while for people to &quot;get-it&quot; eventually and i believe the difference (or lack thereof) between the 4s and 5 has started to open people's eyes lol!</text>

    <text>would pay more attention to this company if they'd give proper respect to the company whose ip they absconded. said company would be xerox. mr cook, kindly listen to your predecessor's comments, as well as interviews. and follow that comment you made regarding &quot;doing the right thing&quot;. and having a company with a culture worth passing on. by the way, why not ( gsmarena ) do a review of apple's best vs androids best. pantech has several models. why not the pantech vega r3. or one of these pantech vega im-a850, asus padfone 2 and the xiaomi mi-2... why not one of these latest efforts. after all the iphone 5 was just released, right??</text>

    <text>today apple announced q3 sales report and  result  no so good compare previous quarter. look like many poeples start switch to android phone. samsung q3 earned beauty profits after apple banned their products at some country but result better than apple.very funny. samsung another hit is note 2 after s3.</text>

    <text>some see ios's curated approach as a weakness but it is already proving itself in security.  some of the most popular apps on android are currently leaking personal data as we speak. these are not some obscure apps, but very popular apps already downloaded by millions, but the researchers chose not to expose the names.    malware has increased 580% over just one year, and 23 apps on google play have now been labelled as high risk:    seriously, as a new buyer, if you read news like this, why on earth would you go with android? even if i hated apple so much, i would simply go with wp8.</text>

    <text>hey guys, couldn't you just write opinions and reviews what you like or dislike about it? it's just a handset, holy ..., it's not your loved nor your hated person. no phone is the absolute best and can never be, eg. for me the best is lumia 920, but sure as hell it's not the best for an android type of guy nor for an apple one, and i would not suggest it to either. everybody can find his/her suitable gadget to buy easily just by gsmarena reviews, no need for these stupid bashings here. praising or offending a phone so hectically is sooooo disgusting!</text>

    <text>you guys want to know why developers are not focusing on android?  it's much harder to program a program for android.  even after thats done, they don't know how the phone will run this program.  for example, abc app works fine, however the htc one might run this app better then the s3.  it also depends on the phone. so it's inconsistent, and of course you don't expect the developers to make sure the app is flawless for all android phones.  so it's useless.  another thing, my friend works as a programmer, he said, developers or high end ones will focus more on apple.  so stop using the &quot;apple fan boy&quot;  it's nothing to do with that.  you get apple, you get access to the best applications on the planet.  even if that app is available on a an android phone, 95 % of the time, the apple version is superior.  you guys complain about apple not having a micro sd card slot, that card is utterly useless, unless your storing photos, video's or music, cause more apps do not run off those memory cards.  so yes, the ios for now, will always have the upper on android based on applications. apps apps apps.  if you don't care about apps, and if android phone makes you happy, go for it.   i'm not making this up, this was straight up from my friend who is a app developer.</text>

    <text>excuse me guys... iphone is best and u ppl shd accept it... i used iphone 3g, iphone 4, ipod touch 4g... now i bought sony xperia p android phone a month b4... i used gs2 n 3 too.. i wish i had enough money to buy iphone 4s or 5... ofcourse iphones are expensive but thay r best... i miss ios.. ios is best.. android is good but cant beat ios.. and still i dnt knw, whats the idea of homescreen when u can directly go to menu from lockscreen.. android has also apps compatibility issues... isnt this strange that only single ios device/year gives a tough competition to 100s of android mobiles released that year... that's y iphone is best...i accept that ios 6 has maps problem but it will soon b fixed... and its not true that ios cant b customized... in cydia there r a lot of apps that can customize the lockscreen as well as springboard e.g winterboard... and jailbreaking is soooo easy... just download the required redsnow and click on jailbreak..u r done... and getting cracked apps for iphone is the easiest thing.... on android rooting is required for too many decent apps... which voids the warranty.. jailbreaking is legal.. i wish i cud install ios on my sony xperia.. conclusion:- ios is bestttt..</text>

    <text>as a blackberry user, i've got to say that ios is very boring, my friend has iphone 5 and the only things i like, is the screen quality and the lack of lag. i wonder how he can bear rows of icons on daily basis. on the other hand, i tried android 4.0 (galaxy s2) and it was better, but slight lags here and there, with wide variety of customisation, i liked the homescreen and notifications bar better. but then again, apple spends like months to optimize for a single device, so i don't like it when apple fans brag about 0 -lag. if android phone producers, spent months, optimizing their chipsets, i guess i would find no difference in performance between iphone5 and the galaxy s2. until that time, i think i'll stay with my blackberry.</text>

    <text>love the trolls. they don't stop coming.  you buy apple products for high resale rate, durability, quality, and most important, superior applications.  you want a bigger screen?  get a fat phone.  to me iphone5 is hella expensive.  so is the s3.  anything about 200 bucks is expensive to me, so to argue over, the s3 is cheaper, is not a winning argument. it's immature, and it represents the mindset of apple haters.  this is the best phone and highest rated phone in the world, and it will continue to sell into december.</text>

    <text>evolution still has a limit to it let it be technology or anything... just like symbian faced its evolution limit...there was nothing new they could give then... the reason why android could give more with s s2 s3 or say note 1&amp;2 is coz they started off with practically nothing before that (give and take some models from other brands or the same brand as well)... now then comes the period of loyalty...when people still took to windows7 after the great fall of vista...of course their loyalties were rewarded... just because iphone didn't give much of an update (apparently, those who actually use it know there are) - suddenly all attacks begin to be like 'omg what's new in this, same old?!!' as if they are just waiting to gather reasons for hating apple... all haters can say is what - no sd, simple ui, no customization(only layman in technology would say that), no multitasking(apple gives multitasking where its needed, of course you can download videos and play games with music player on) no bluetooth ftp(forgot to mention but it may get passe like infrared with wifi sharing, who knows), limited system, no radio (well this one even i wanted to see), no high specs to boast of (which doesn't even count with iphone5 slightly below s3 even with half the spec)...these were present even when the iphone3 was released and people hated it comparing nokia 5800... nothing new to reason for such hating even now??? so now android (superficial) lovers should actually find out some new in themselves to hate apple...</text>

    <text>the real truth between ios and android. apple haters will not mention to a friend to avoid them from buying apple iphone.  what makes apple superior to any android phone no matter what.  applications.  programmers are more focused on developing high quality applications for the apple because it's easier.  thus giving them much better apps.  android users say &quot;no no they are the same&quot;  the truth, is, this is not.  apple's os have much much better applications then the android.  source : this is not made up, this is straight from a friend who works at a programming company that makes apps.    sd card.  we won't know whats apple reason for not having a micro sd card slot.  however, apple is fully aware, (as they work very close to those programmers) that these programmers do not allow these apps to be able to run out of the sd card.  this is &quot;most programmers&quot; do not allow this.  so its utterly useless, since apps cannot run out of the sd card anyways. it's only good for storing music and photos i guess. which is kinda useless too, since there should be more then enough space on a 16gb iphone.  how many photos do you really have? 20000? cmon, how bout songs? are you really going to have 800 songs?  ios update. the iphone will suport up to the next 3 updates.  so for example, the iphone 5, can be upgraded up until the ios8, as for android, it can only be updated once!  so pretty much, that s3, you update the android once, and thats it. it will not allow another update, and you will need to buy another android phone.  thus why apple is superior to any other phone out there.  android users can feel free to brag about how great it is.  go ahead.  but this is the real truth, apple applications &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; android applications.  no joke.  if your not writing programs for the iphone, your not a reputable programming company. once they prove their worth writing android apps, they will go to apple, and hope they make it to the big boys, to the &quot;real phone company&quot;</text>

    <text>a major shift is already coming, the android collective will be splintered by the arrival of wp8. unlike ios which has a loyal following, a big majority of android users are simply owners of cheap smartphones, who haven't an inkling at all if you ask them what android is. wp8 led by nokia will probably win a lot of these users back, with the more appealing lower end wp8 phones.  2013 is going to be a super interesting year!</text>

    <text>bgr iphone 5 review: month with the iphone 5    &quot;the iphone 5 is undoubtedly the most impressive iphone apple has launched to date, but its also more than that: it separates apple from its rivals by a wider margin than ever before. in terms of hardware quality and in terms of core software performance, the new iphone has no peers.  apples competition still offers a number of advantages over the iphone in different areas, but the complete package the iphone delivers  the end-to-end experience that results from hardware, software and services that are cohesive and elegant  is in a class by itself.&quot;</text>

    <text>its true that iphone was the god of phones before but after the samsung galaxy s2 came out the iphone popularity gradually decreases, samsung makes better specs and bigger screen new features plus support with android, many phone manufactures follow thei path it seems android phones standard features are quadcore, 2g ram, 2100+mah bat, 13mp cam, 5 inch disp. android jellybean 4.1.. android phones are non stopable continuing to denomination of the mobile world. the closest device next to pc is android phone.</text>

    <text>the big problem in iphone5 is that with the screen size a bit bigger than the previous ones.....we are not getting some applications like games and many other social applications does not fit to the screen size, i mean like the application being used in a an iphone4s and iphone5 will have the same amount of screen, rest area in iphone5 remains just black spot screen.....i think apple should make a note of that.....if we can use the extra display area of the screen for the applications then whats the use of the buying a more upgraded version than the previous one....really not happy with that...!! :(</text>

    <text>i've had my iphone 5 for about a week now, and i love it. it's fast, with a super snappy response. the camera produces crisp, clear images. the user interface is simple and easy to use, and you cannot deny the impressive aesthetics of this phone. it's lightweight, despite all its features, and the aluminium backing makes the phone feel not only sturdier than the plastic on s3's and note 2's, but looks great also.  the new earbuds deserve more credit; it pumps sound directly down your ear canal so there's no need blasting your music on high volumes, and it fits better in my ear too.  i am loving the iphone 5, but i won't go to say that its better than the samsung s3, or note2. it really is down to personal preference what people prefer.</text>

    <text>i'm a huge apple fan , i got the macbook, ipad , and previous 4s user and recently i switched. i was waiting for the iphone 5 to released back couple of month ago and finally when it released i was hoping it didn't . all the excitement were totally gone and it just really look like either a rush product or they just don't  have any new ideas. when i went to my local phone shop they have a iphone 5 on display and i was amaze no one want to look at it , there isnt anyone playing with it. i guess there is nothing much to fiddle with as is pretty much the same to the previous and the previous ,previous .........after seen my gf galaxy note and some new androids on the market it just make the look iphone really outdated. so i've switched to galaxy note 2 and enjoyed every feature that is missing on the iphone . oh yeah one warning :using the iphone for to long makes you dumb, as there is a amount of learning curve when you switched to new upmarket device . there is just too much feature on other devices. cheers guys!</text>

    <text>i dont have this phone but i own one of the best iphone and i say it is amazing . i know many haters in this forum will disagree with me. but let me ask you this. what are you doing here if don't like this phone? are you trying to convince people that already bought this phone and hate it as much as you do? or are you just plain and simply bashing out this phone and hold up high your own phone? people who bought this, love this and use this as a communication tool. remember, the basic function of the phone is to stay connected. games and apps are only secondary or do not count much. i take care of things i own cause i want them to last. so, whatever phone you own, the most important thing is that your are connected to the people you value in your life!</text>

    <text>root is for people who wants to make their phone a petri dish.  there should be a manual that comes with root, to guide those people who dont know the risk ( 99 % of users), and prevent them from bricking their phones. (as much as 1.3 getting activated daily, .5 m is getting phased out/replaced, .3 m is getting bricked/deadboot)  as for iphone and lumia phone, you dont need root to get the most out of your phone.</text>

    <text>actually anyone who knows anything about anything knows polycarbonate is the best material for a phone because it's light,  flexible,  shock proof, scratch resistant with colour impregnated into it and much easier and cheaper to replace. but people just want to believe the iphone's better quality because it has the more expensive materials when it is 100% style over substance. i mean metal's fine on a car because you just hammer the dents out but a dent in the iphone is permanent, and i admit the s3 should have had better side protection which is why it breaks easier along with the sheer size of the screen but that's just the way it is.</text>

    <text>nokia sells it's patents at reasonable market value but apple often charges over twice as much for some patents to some companies than it does to others simply because they more of a competition and find any way possible to forcibly reduce profits and sales of it's competition, and sometimes instead of paying for a patent they just take companies to court because it's cheaper to use the broken us patent system for an easy victory than pay to keep using the patent.</text>

    <text>i think phones have almost become like shoes now where some people judge you by what you wearing, and i really think the image the iphone gives off now is someone who's not very imaginative and like you say &quot;technically inept&quot; and if apple has almost lost that designer brand image and offering almost no innovation now then apple really doesn't have much left except for people being stuck with possibly thousands of dollars invested in itunes and app store and lose everything if they change brand.</text>

    <text>if apple just changed some resistors and other circuitry they can probably convince the average iphone user that each of those is a new feature, and i'm betting if there's a new icon or menu name they'll also class that as a feature just to make them believe it has 200 new features.</text>

    <text>the iphone and ios grows at a steady rate, each generation rings in new customers, word of mouth from loyal customers, happy with their product. android is not so easy to predict, as the bulk is from feature phone owners who simply upgraded to cheaper smartphones.  this is why even though market share wise android is bigger, iphone actually leads the way with web usage for example. with wp8 coming into the picture, also with cheaper smartphones, android market share logically is simply set to tumble. the only question is by how much?</text>

    <text>:p with the release of the new iphone, and as industry analysts expected, every single accomplishment mankind has achieved was rendered irrelevant. i was able to stop salivating and rubbing iphone all over my body long enough to compile a list of its greatest features. no matter what you're doing on your new iphone, you can pull up twitter and tweet about it. which is good, because it was hard to twitter before, and that barrier to entry has potentially cost us millions of important tweets. imagine the nightmare scenario where a man sits eating a tuna fish sandwich and tried to tweet about how &quot;yummers&quot; it was, but had to push the home button and open his favorite twitter app! &quot;forget that&quot; the man said, turning back to his tuna fish sandwich. and then, horrifically, that tweet was lost to us forever. with the iphone, you don't have to pay for awful data plans to send text messages! i mean, that is assuming you're only connecting with other people using ios devices like the ipad and iphone. and of course you are. you wouldn't associate with &quot;those people&quot; (people using android). i wouldn't say i hate them, but i definitely pity them. 'll never forget the dark days when we had only one core in our chips. at least four times a day i would ask myself if someone had stolen all the cores from my phone before i recalled that, no, this is just how the phone was made. the camera in the iphone 4s/5 is remarkable. honest to god i took a picture of a leaf blowing in the wind and this camera actually picked up that moment's intangible poetry.</text>

    <text>it's funny how trolls like terrier, and other iphone haters, are just spewing random b.s, non stop.  hopelessly thinking they can bring down apple, ironically apple is the fastest growing phone company in the world.  sorry to say, 1 in 4 people in my city owns an &quot;iphone&quot;.  while 1 in 5 owns an iphone in the country.  80% of those who don't own a smartphone at the moment plans on getting an &quot;iphone&quot; in the near future.  this was a recent poll taken in my province alone.  i think apple shares has grown 500 million in the past 2 years alone, as their shares were just 14% 2 years ago, and now its at 18%.  anyways, you guys think you know everything, i read up on every single site, that reviews the iphone5, all of them have nothing but great things to say about the phone. the only people saying negative stuff about apple, are the nerds sitting behind a pc, and writing it up on forums like this.   you losers keep on saying, &quot;no features , no features,&quot;  i06 alone has 200 new features when it was released, i don't even know where this, &quot;no features&quot; came from.  all you apple hating losers just know how to speak a few words.  i personally think apple was generous enough to instead of putting these 200 new features into the iphone 5, anyone that owns an iphone5 gets these features.  these apple hating punks, are also as dumb as a rock.  it's like they only know how to speak a few words.  it goes like this.  &quot;i hope your gf didn't dump you for the half inch&quot; &quot; ohhhhh no theres is no memory slots.. boooooooo&quot; ironically there are many android phones without this feature&quot; &quot;oh no radio?  noooooo&quot;  (some android phones don't have this too) &quot;i'm dumping my iphone for a s3&quot;  it's funny it's always the s3.  that's what makes it unbelievable. heard this one too many times.  it's never i'm dumping my ip for a xone or something else. &quot;it's only half an inch longer, nothing more, don't get it.&quot;  anyways, you guys can really go suck on it.  the ios is a superior os to the android, thats what ever programmer out there will tell you.  they will also tell you.  the reviews are there in color.  no one is lying. everyone that i know owns the ip5, have no issues with it, and have no problems with it.  they all love it, theres no problems. just another phone on the rise.  you can come here and say &quot;the s3 is better&quot;  you guys aren't fooling anyone. go to sleep.  if you guys don't like the ip5, don't get it.  apple users don't give !@$$'s like apple haters.  unbelievable.</text>

    <text>i had mine last night and its my 1st day to use ths iphone 5. battery is really good! though at first its really a new experience with the 4&quot; screen and took some time to get used with a larger screen. and i must admit that iphone 4 and 4s has more elegant look. but the iphone 5 stand out with its new feel of lighter and all in all kinda dissapointed with the ios 6 i hope they could do better than that with its competetors andriod.</text>

    <text>in reality the rating of this phone is at least a 9, but i can guarantee that all the s3 fangirls are coming over here and voting 1's just because that's what they do, hate on the iphone, while we iphone users enjoy our devices, know it beats the s3, but keep it to ourselves. that's why it's at 6.5.</text>

    <text>you iphone haters are simply naive and ignorant. after the launch of iphone 5 you ambushed this phone based on its map debacle. so now the map issue was fixed, now you don't have anything concrete to hurl at iphone you use bluetooth. because of that i have bought iphone's for my garden boy &amp; domestic worker for its superiority. htc the king of smartphones and iphone the queen of smartphones. samsung the p. a of both the king and the queen. lol</text>

    <text>sadly i am using iphone5 and ipad3. my honest rating for both product is 2/3. i have noticed one thing, when you are taking picture with flash it comes darker than without flash. and at night its all dark. i went to starford brach they said its the prob with ios6. but hey why i need to suffer. if your os is not compatible with the device why an earth you developed it and cheating with customers?! they told me to wait for next upgrade but dont know it will release. so dissapointed with apple and its products.</text>

    <text>the biggest argument against apple that i often hear is the fact that you have to use itunes to load up your media. but is it really such a big deal? i have a windows pc and i already have itunes on it. i downloaded it just to see what it looked like, and that took like ten minutes. and itunes discovers the media thats already on you hard drive, so whats the problem really???  right now i have a lg optimus black and i don't know if its the phone or what, but anytime i connect with the cable to upload new songs it has to start installing drivers and acting up; the whole process sometimes crashes and i have to start again - it can get tedious. and removing the memory card is fine software wise, but its begun to make my battery cover loose because of always having to remove it each time.  i wanna replace my ob with iphone mainly because of resale value. when i bought my ob it cost me $500 - i've tried to look after it the best i can, but when i sell it, the best i'm gonna get is $250 because of my loose battery cover and a few scratches on the plastic back - plus the fact that androids are all about spec - and my spec is too old. however with iphone the story is different. when i bought my ob, iphone4s 32 gb was going for about $1250 in my country. now they cost $1100 brand new, and a good condition second hand will go for between $900 and $950. they hold their value better - it just makes more sense. so i'm keen to dump android for a while, and try something new. i don't use widgets or live wallpapers much anymore - grew out of it i guess: plus they just eat battery, memory and data. there is really nothing to loose, provided my phone doesn't get lost or broken.</text>

    <text>android is simply imploding with multiple unsolvable problems and wp8 is stepping in to replace the platform, (not instantly of course). fragmentation makes app optimization almost impossible. inefficient multitasking wasted battery life.  poor security results in fbi warning. 700% rise in malware over one quarter only. very poor updating has resulted in majority on gingerbread, with no signs of upgrading anytime soon.  if you don't like iphone, get lumia. android is on the way down.</text>

    <text>all you apple haters, enjoy your android device, enjoy the numerous crashes. i've tested 98% off all smartphones that hit the market place and sorry, the iphone will always be the leader of the pack. it's not buggy, it's smooth and does exactly what it is supposed to do. android is a great idea, however the lags and multiple crashing occurrences must be fixed. there is a reason why you have to spend a bit more to get an apple, however lemons are cheaper.</text>

    <text>you see i like apple phones they are stirdy, strong and provide a user friendly interface. but they dont seem to compete with the android phones out there.  for example: htc, samsung s3 + lg optimus all using quadcore, where as this phone is using a dual core processor. that is quite sad... considering people masturbate of iphones. talking about the hardware and software. software is good but lacks the fact that you can't customize with widgets.  i like the shape of it and the plating of the phone. but seriously, there isn't much of a different since the 4s. yeah a6 chip, better camera and a bigger screen. also, you can't do as much as you can do on androids. connecting to a pc to transfer music, you have to have itunes. thats seriously annoying unless you find ways round it like i did. you have to do a lot to set it up as well.  if anything i would recommend an android, this piece of technology is great but it's a clear cut ripp off for price. also it's not worth it for what you get. considering statisically! adroids like the s3 are better. iphone: dual core 1.2 ghz samsung s3: qaud core 1.5ghz  which ones better, be intelligent. don't follow the hype.</text>

    <text>how can iphone 5 be the best??? just check out the gsmarena review of its cons against the galaxy s3: iphone cons main disadvantages  aluminum body looks cool but is easy to scratch proprietary connector, incompatible with previous-gen accessories (needs adapter) the new display is not proportionally bigger, but only taller unadapted apps run letterboxed due to the unusual resolution, nano-sim support only, apple maps app not up to scratch, no usb mass storage mode, no fm radio no stereo speakers no microsd card slot no nfc connectivity (though that may be nitpicking) stuck with itunes for loading content mono audio recording in videos  samsung galaxy s3 cons: all-plastic body of dubious aesthetics no dedicated camera key microsim slot s voice is hardly as functional as ads might make you believe  now, which is the best of the two?</text>

    <text>breaking news*** with millions of units shipped, and demand significantly outstripping supply, the initial launch of the iphone 5 can probably be described as successful. ad tracking firm has released some data comparing iphone 5 mobile ad impressions to those from the galaxy s iii, a popular android phone released by samsung.  according to the firm, the three-week old iphone 5 saw significantly more web traffic than the galaxy s iii, a phone that has been out for months.</text>

    <text>haha1 big slap for the arrogant fruity company!  &quot;the us court of appeals for the federal circuit ruled that the district court in california had &quot;abused its discretion in entering an injunction&quot;. the appeals court has sent the case back to a lower california court for reconsideration.  the nexus is an ageing product in samsung's line-up, with a plethora of new tablets and smartphones intended for launch before christmas. but the overturning of the pre-trial ban is something of a slap across the face for apple, because the patents in the nexus case  which involve software-enabled features such as click-to-zoom  are directly related to features of android, which powers the majority of the world's smartphones&quot;.</text>

    <text>for all you apple haters out there, it really comes down to this. what ever phone people have, has nothing to do with you.  stop randomly making stuff up, and slamming it to death.  every major site that reviewed the ip5 gave it a real good score.  if you don't like it, don't f in buy it.  there's no point coming here and saying negative stuff about it.  after reading the patents apple has for the ip6, i personally think, apple is saving their true powers for ip6.  i think diliberatly made the ip5, (normal) so normal that when the ip6 comes out, the improvement gap is so wide, that it will garner soooo much attention that everyone will want it even more.    the above link is what they are stirring up for their ip6.  expect it to come out in 2 years.   apple is once again going to bring phone usage to the next level with the ip6 beast.  apple is not going to dick around anymore.  they are going to patent everything.  it's  hilarious.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is good but still lack many features and i cansay some important ones:  1st point.  it will be nice to have &quot;mass storage mode&quot;  but in the end, its suppose a f in smart phone.  not an external usb drive.  if you really want something like that, get a android phone that requires constant updates and fixes.  2nd point.  you have a good point there.  it will be nice to be able to download stuff straight to the phone.  i give you a point on that.   but once again, it's not neccessary.  smart phones are intended for making phone calls.  recieving phone calls.  bonus is surfing the internet, and checking emails, and occasionally watching video's.  these are by far the most used features on a smart phone.  but once again, to be able to do this, it comes with a price.  problems problems, problems with the o.s.  yup.  android.  3.  this point is rather subjective.  so no point for you.  anyone can literally slam the ip5 for not having enough features.  even if they nice &quot;widgets&quot; it still wont be good enough for apple haters like yourself.  4  personally any phone that is 300 dollars to me is already expensive.  you get what you pay for. if it's too expensive don't buy it. cause honestly, 650 bucks for the s3 is too expensive for me too, for an over sized phone that is made out of plastic.  5 crappy apps.  any professional programmer will be laughing at you.  their apps are better then androids.  androids have more apps because its open sourced, but that comes with a price.  programmers find much more difficult to make an app for android because some phones, android will run that program differently which in the end, causing progblems.  one of the cons of having an android phone.  they will also tell you, it is so much easier to write a program for ios.  but once again, the pro's of having android phone, lots of apps.  lots of useless apps too. 6  your 6th point is literally a slap in your own face.  this is a huge advantage for apple owners, to be able to use android functions in their apple.  can android phones use ios?  no f in way.  also how many of these phones actually go back to apple for warranty?  your are looking at 1 device to every 10000 that needs some sort of warranty.</text>

    <text>are you guys naive or obstinated? htc one x+ is out now with a massive hardware in it but nobody is welcome the great work that htc has done over the original one x. however, the amendments are subtle between one x &amp; one x+ the same as iphone 4s &amp; iphone 5. it mustn't be a secret iphone has the most powerful/gorgeous software while htc brags with gigantic hardware. the truth must told, htc remains the king of smartphones.</text>

    <text>&quot;you gotta admit that the note 2 and even the s3 has a greater processing power than the iphone 5 and it also support flash player which will greatly increase your web browsing experience and further enhance the versitility of your phone which the iphone 5 does'nt support. so why buy an iphone 5? for me iphone 5 is just a piece of crap.&quot;  oh gosh, speaking of that. i was testing my buddies my s3.  did it for a good 10 minutes.  in that 10 minutes i noticed 4 glitches one.  was browing a website.  i wanted to look at it horizontal.  so i decided to make it horizontal, (was't very responsive) but anyways, when i made it horizontal it brought me back to the main page!  wtf is this!  my search has been erased!  (youtube)  was youtubing looper trailer. 1st time i chose looper trailer, it opened up resident evil.  2nd time it opened up avengers trailer, 3rd time looper finally opened up looper trailer.  and oh can i say dropped calls?  lol.  that was from his end when i was talking to him.  how bout power cycling?  lol.  android fail.  always will fail.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is good  but still lack many features and i cansay some important ones: 1.no usb mass storage mode this is the worst thing ever.absolutely every phone has a mass storage mode,which alloews you to browse files from your pc.on this you cant,onlyu sync music with itunes which.,...sucks so bad 2.do download ability.every phone can download things straight fromthe internet,music,games,videos etc but this cant do it...verylimited again 3.boring ui.its the same ui since iphone 1.everyphone hassomething special:android and symbian have very nice widgets,wp has live tiles,web os has a very smart uit with swipe and stuff,even the nokia n9 owns this phone as the uiwith its swipe ui.after all of these,the iphone only has those boring icons again and again 4.very expensive...no more to say about it...1000$ while s3=550,note 2=650,optimus g=500 5.crappy apps.dont get me wrong but even tho it has polished apps that work smooth on it,every crappy app needs to be paid.i can say very very many apps on ios that are free on android:fruit ninja,angrybirds,dead trigger,frontline commando,dungeondefenders 2,bad piggies,jetpack joyride.need to say more? 6.no jailbrak,no nothing.iphone isnt anything without jailbreak which voids the warranty.in order to do something with it,you must jailbrak it. there are also more things to say like the lack of flas player, a doc viewer,no bluetooth functions and the list can go on...</text>

    <text>when the note 1 cames out people said it was stupid because it was to big to be a phone and to small to be a tablet, and now the note 2 is the best? why? its more powerfull but it has the same problem! i had a s3 but i switch it for an iphone 5 and i made the best choice i could made! the s3 its also a little big to be a phone and i prefer to have a small beast like iphone 5 and a big beast like the new ipad, wich i own too, to watch multimedia and play games! i can have a powerfull smartphone experience with iphone 5 and a powerfull tablet experience with the new ipad, i dont want a device that its in the middle of this two, but thats only my opinion! no to mention the exclusive and smooth user experience that apple provides with ios, an unique os!</text>

    <text>absolutely no doubt the iphone5 is a  good looking phone,shoot,the 4 is awesome looking with the glass on both sides,but unfortunately,this handset was introduced with some faults,right off the bat.not many other high end devices have been introduced as praised and regarded as this one, and have had the president of the company come out and say &quot;we made a mistake&quot;(maps)this quickly.i am not trolling but simply not keeping silent as i was in line to buy the new ipod touch but have turned my back on apple for being brats in the american courtrooms and no longer being innovative.</text>

    <text>the iphone 5 doesnt matter here most. even if they made a clay pot, its irrelavent. from a users aspect, what matters most is the eco system that they build. it worth a million. it too easily drove users that were nose drown with crapps to a heaven of shiny and a more plenary collection of apps. just look at how many start ups (as apps and standalone services) have been created around it (eco system)</text>

    <text>i am a sgs3 user and no doubt an apple hater. but it is wrong to just write the iphone 5 off as it is undoubtedly one of the fastest phones in the market today. sure they screwed up with the maps and design but apple does know how to make an os run in superb fashion even with limited resources. i prefer the s3 over the iphone for a simple reason, its easier to use, more user friendly when it comes to using day to day devices with the phone (usb, bluetooth etc.). apart from that we do not have to buy apps to be able to use them. i think the s3 is better value for money over the iphone 5. i cannot comment on the performance extensively since i do not use and have never used the iphone</text>

    <text>what's not to like about iphone 5? smartphone has become part of me - might as well just integrate it onto my palm - and using it is not like a beauty contest between phones. personally it'd be tiring if every iteration was revolutionary. turn-by-turn navigation was long overdue - i love it - and the map will catch up with google sooner than iphone haters will realise. google map is still accessible on safari anyway and the app offered to iphone users like myself was never good to start with. i prefer longer screens (over my 3gs) for two reasons that are important to me: (1) i see more usable list items and the (2) hd videos looks right and no longer has the annoying stretch option. you like big tv-sized screen you'll enjoy s3/htc. the iphone 5 camera edges seems more distorted than i'd have liked and i hate the bottom position of the headphone socket. my current usage of constant messaging and news reading lasts me 2 full days. someone mentioned that turning lte on (where it's unavailable) will drain battery unnecessarily so i'm testing with it off.</text>

    <text>as expected, a couple of weeks of frenzy by the haters, and now things have settled down. slate magazine writer even apologised and wrote a whole new article saying he was wrong, and the iphone 5 is the greatest smartphone ever built. wow can you imagine someone actually doing that?  scratch stories have gone since it was probably just an initial batch, and maps not only is it not a disaster, but now people are praising its advanced features. apple maps auto-cache actually saves double the data of google maps offline mode.  lol, just like the iphone 4s last year, it has weathered the initial hate storm, and come out renewed, a great smartphone.</text>

    <text>ip5 vs s3, ip5 vs bla,bla,bla  cmon, people  this  is competition. we cant blame phone manufacturer if they wanted to copy other feature from the other brand which they believe it could satisfy the consumer. i am a user of galaxy s3, though i love iphone but prefer to use s3.  i can say the plastic is quite thin that it could easily break.but i love the specs, it was even funny to see their s-voice a copycat of siri lol. but yes it is competition and it always happens. why do just look on the positive side of it, coz without competition phones today could not be as hi-tech than they were today. it is a part of phones evolution, the more competition happens the more upgrades will be presented soon.. just enjoy your phone men. you bought it and you must love it like i do.  more power to all of you guys i phone and s3 users...!</text>

    <text>from the article:  &quot;now, almost a month later, its time for me to get something off my chest: ive made a huge mistake. ive had the iphone 5 for about a week and a half, and im still annoyed about the dock connector thing. but its a small problem, and in retrospect i was wrong to allow myself to become overwhelmed by dock-based frustration.  thats because, in all other ways, the iphone 5 is the best phone ever to grace the earth. it beats every single rival on just about every metric you can think of, including speed, battery life, and especially beauty and workmanship.&quot;</text>

    <text>i've the black iphone 5, it does scratch easily, the white one is much better for casual user; not for business man.  iphone 5 is not bad, but not the best for the price. i brought an oppo finder last week in china (black color), and find that the phone is not bad (for half the price of my iphone 5). come with android 4.0, and the phone is amazingly thin. build quality on par with iphone 5 (both made in china). oppo finder feel real nice in the hand, and the size is about perfect (my iphone 5 screen size is still a little too small in real life usage).</text>

    <text>went to my apple store in my area.  metrotown burnaby.  did a scratch test on my own.  keep in mind these are units that are used by thousands of people per week.  looked at a white unit, no scratch marks.  decided to give it a good scratching.  no scratch marks appear.  the rumors that this phone is easily scratcheable is the biggest b.s known to man.  if you don't treat any phone devices with care, it will be scratched! no questions asked. anyone who owns a ip5, is stupid not to get a protective case for a 700 dollar phone.  but anyways, but on the scratch, there were not visable scratch marks after i scratched it.  people complainging about the scracthing issue, is probably a careless iphone owner, or a android phone user posing as a ip5 owner and complaining about it.  nuff said.  you don't believe me? go to your apple store and just scracth the phone.  of course not superhard, just regular scratch.    b.s.  android users will use whatever tactic they can say to slam the ip5.</text>

    <text>i was an iphone 4 user before i switched to a samsung galaxy s iii as i was bored with my iphone 4 and i wanted to try something new. and so i did. the samsung galaxy s iii was good phone but i eventually got pissed by it occasionally freezing and some apps crashing. it was a nice phone but the my experience with it unfortunately wasn't all that nice. and now, i've purchased a new iphone 5. it's all so different from and better than samsung galaxy s iii. it's so fast, and buttery smooth, never encountered a single crash on my apps. i just love it. i don't get the hate. people should really try the iphone 5 first before bashing it. because i've already tried probably the best android phone and my  experience with it is just not comparable to my experience with the iphone 5. to me, nothing beats the iphone 5 for the best user experience.</text>

    <text>i have to say, i own an iphone 4 and it is nothing short of an amazing device, however i got my hands on an iphone 5, and really surprised, first of all the the phone feels cheaper in quality than the iphone 4, yet its more expensive, i expected them to add 4mm to the width on just must make it dis-proportionally longer, you worse off with ios 6, no native you tube app, maps not the same,my car does not recognize ios 6, lost huge functionality here. before steve jobs launched a product he made sure what he launched was nothing short of perfect, and that case delays paid off, but now apple's strategy of delivering on time shows a standard rushed product, that does not fit with the apple culture.  no majors apps where prepared to launch with this phone, how different it was when steve launched the iphone 4!  2. i believe apple have also go wrong with its new operating systems. i never want my mac book pro into an ipad type gadget!! most people have standard professional applications they want to use on there pc, many people are not interested in cluttering their pc with semi professional applications which end up being used a few times as they would on an iphone. what hurts even more is the core programs that distinguished a mac have not been well updated to function smoothly. in the past apple used the motto 'everything works with a mac' apple lived to that motto, now before apple keeps launching a new os every year i think they should make the software companies have their software updated in time so that 'everything works' as things stand now, as third parties update the software to work properly, apple launches a new os,many people just upgrade blindly and then face the music after with things not working as they should.  apple should forget their call values if they are to keep their success, with iphone 5, i think apple are  going to give an open hand to samsung to sell more s3 phones and soon to be s4 versions.  as for the iphone 5, i'm giving it a miss till they launch a better iphone.</text>

    <text>this is the worst innovation of the year. nothing new. same old grand daddy story. same design nothing changed. except bigger screen. only those cannot see logic will say this is a good phone. yes better ios but not fantastic as compare to competitors like siii or optimus 4x. i think lumia 920 will beat iphone 5 with one eyes close. shame on those raving fans keep saying its good its good. its like saying shit is delicious. the facts is obvious. tks</text>

    <text>people say that apple just want our money and just want to sell but an iphone its a good investiment, for me is the best! the iphone 4 still gets updates and it was released 2 years ago! with iphone 5 i have a super smartphone for 2 years at list! and allways updated! and android phones? you buy one top android phone and after a couple of months some company release one wich is better and with a new version of android that your mobile doesnt support or supports but cant use all the advantages that the update brings! and everybody say that ios doesnt have this and that, things that android phones have, but for what? apple is a premium and different brand and they dont want to copy and be like the other companies. its true that they can improve some things but to do things right and with top quality it takes time! android phones have a lot of things its true, but the problems are a lot too and people cant have a good experience without thinking if they will get the next update to solve all the problems they have. iphone 5 rocks and only the real apple users</text>

    <text>fair enough, samsung manufacture, but credit must go to the designer. without an architect, the taj mahal, eiffel tower etc would not be built no matter how many labourers you used. credit must go to apple for the design. on the other hand, if chinese labourers were not available for example, perhaps others could be used.  so, while samsung were the manufacturers used, this is less important, as shown now by apple switching chip manufacturers from samsung to tsmc. so, while apple switches manufacturers, they still get their a6 chip. see?</text>

    <text>the main arguments against iphone which android people have been repeating; expensive, no radio, etc etc are in fact getting weaker and weaker. why? cos the iphone has been out since 2007, five years now, and six generations of iphone. in the beginning it may have been an issue for some, but almost everyone is now familiar with iphone, ios, and what it has and doesn't have.  this means that people are choosing iphone anyway, so there really is something to apple's 'user experience' philosophy. ever wondered why wp8 philosophy is closer to ios even though android has the larger market share?  iphone is a proven success, while android is grappling with unsolvable systemic issues. malware, fragmentation, and this crippled because of an agonizing slow upgrade path, making solutions impossible. majority of android owners phones still at risk of the data wipeout malware, and helpless to do anything unless they root their phones.</text>

    <text>i have been using iphone 4s since 10 months. what i have learnt from my experience is that iphone is not just about what things you can do with it but how you do it. other phones might have 100s of features which are not there in iphone. some might be useful of them but most are implemented just for the sake of differentiating with iphone. they are seldom useful. on the other hand loads of features that iphone have are much much better implemented on it than competition. just a bigger screen does not makes a phone hugely advanced than a smaller screen phone.</text>

    <text>apple goes for the philosophy of designing something as well as possible, and as timeless as possible. it then polishes that design. this is what it has also done on its macbooks and imacs.  what you then get are beautiful timeless smartphones, which are portals to apps, the highlight of ios.  android's focus is on hardware, because manufacturers all use same the same os. unfortunately this leads to wastage as manufacturers are constantly needing to introduce new hardware, leaving phones obsolete within months, and reducing value.  the iphone market is much more stable and iphones retain value more because of this.</text>

    <text>all phones have their own specifications.  ios requires minimum instruction per second than android os which is more complex.  that's why for an android phone like i am using, it needs more cpu strength to handle the instructions per second. observe the windows phone like lumnia phones, at 800mhz cpu still running smooth. i used xperia arc s, optmus black, lumnia, e5, e72, and now my latest s3.  but i also used i phone 4s, but not mine lol. just borrowed from a friend. all i can say they have their own pro and cons, sample: in s3 graphics are very detailed, i played dead trigger, counter strike mobile etc. it runs so smooth, while in the 4s it sometimes lag in 3d games. but when it comes to handling i prefer 4s coz i can text smoothly unlike s3 which is much bigger.</text>

    <text>for all those, not so smart samsung users, well you say iphone 5 is a dual-core while samung s3 is quad-core, have a look at benchmarks, iphone beats s3! haha! what happened? thats engineering, apple proved itself yet again, its easy to build a higger device with more specs, but to build a device even more compact then its predecessor and yet better then it in every aspect is called inovation which will be there in samsung when they copy apply yet again ;) so all samsung loosers stay tuned ;)</text>

    <text>iphone 4 was defected(bad signal reception), iphone 4s was defected some phones(short battery life), iphone 5(bad camera and some models are scratched). ios is faster because it has no homescreens, no widgets, no developed rooms. ios compare to android has less future of app and software development. iphone 5screen is new so all apps will be shown in smaller screen size(cuted). i dont like apple when they started iphone4. i liked 3gs a lot for design and comfort. i think lg optimus g will be best</text>

    <text>tsmc grabs samsung's chip supply deal    on samsung's slimy tactics from the article:  &quot;history will show samsung refused to honor this request, forcing apple into legal action against it which the copy cat company then attempted to define as cupertino throwing the first punch. thats the business equivalent of the man in a bar who continues to chat up your girlfriend when warned, and then accuses you of assault if you try to stop them.&quot;</text>

    <text>why i still see people say iphone is over price or expensive? those people know anything about calculating? do your math and see other phone on other os! many supporting apps in appstore and always get your latest os upgrade. check with android users, do they still wait for upgrade? they already hopeless and turn into new phone. that's the cost of getting latest android os. u want freedom? jailbreak ur iphone! so many free educated website out there!</text>

    <text>as usual, the hater hype is starting to die down, and millions are happy with their iphones.    &quot;last saturday i visited my local apple store with my friend jackson who had a scheduled genius bar appointment. as i waited for the geniuses to fix his macbook i was wandering the store, at the time checking out the ever so cute 11&amp;#8243; macbook air. as i tried the computer out i couldnt help but notice an apple store employee taking a key to a black iphone 5, just as youve see in the videos.  the customer he was helping had a coupon for an invisiblesheild in her hand, and was asking about how the iphone 5 is reportedly prone to scratches. after the employee finished scratching the iphone (without leaving a mark, may i add) he handed it back to the customer. the customer then threw the coupon in her purse, responding with i guess i wont be needing this after all.  it makes me sad to see the media blow the most finite issue out of proportion. it makes me even more sad when i see these reports affect the buying decisions of consumers. these types of things (antennaegate, scuffgate, mapsgate, etc.) have almost become a joke around the tech community. a joke that has been exaggerated by the media and misunderstood by the normal people who make up the majority of iphone sales.&quot;</text>

    <text>ten days with the iphone 5 review    verdict:  &quot;the iphone 5 is everything i expected from apples next-gen iphone, and more. its everything i love about the iphone 4s, all taken to the next level, and really enhances the iphone experience. from the taller screen to the thinner and lighter build, the iphone 5 is something you truly have to experience for yourself to fully appreciate.  i expected a lot from the iphone 5, and to my pleasant surprise, apple delivered everything i expected and then some. so, why should anybody upgrade to the iphone 5? for me, the answer became apparent from the moment i first held it in my hands.&quot;</text>

    <text>i'm using iphone 4 and excited that i'm given 500 bucks voucher so that i can upgrade without cost to galaxy note ii.  but, my voucher expiry can only allow me to get iphone 5 before expiry, and the starhub telco called that they can deliver iphone 5 right to my door steps, the 64gb version and at no cost.  out of convenience, i agreed, as samsung note ii is not launched in singapore yet, and my voucher can't wait.  i merely &quot;upgrade&quot; at no cost to me based on convenience, as i do not have burning desire to get the iphone 5.  well, after receiving it, physically, yes, slightly longer and lighter.  software wise, i think i'm not impressed nor excited at all, as what i'm getting is some minor software tweaks, just like 4.0 to 4.2 kind of upgrade.  let's not state the obvious, as there are tonnes of reviews out there.  however, my experience had not been very pleasant. 1. it got overheated and show me a message like &quot;overheated, please let it cool before use&quot; can't remember the exact phrase though.  this is new to iphone 5, i never see this message in my iphone 4.  2. battery life is extremely bad.  i thought my iphone 4 is bad, but i'm left with 30% at 1400hrs, i'm full 100% charge at 0930hrs.  i didn't answer call, but having 8 miss calls and some sms.  that's all.  well, perhaps i got a lemon with defective battery.  as far as i'm concern, i'll be selling it away and get note ii, will never return to apply until real innovation comes in their future phones, and not 6 rows for iphone 6.  kip.</text>

    <text>technology tell - i've just about given up on android: on the constant barrage of new phones speeding up obsolescence on phones barely a few months old.    &quot;im sick of companies such as htc, motorola and samsung releasing several variants of the the same phone every year. whats worse is that those who buy into the hype and purchase a so-called flagship, device thats outclassed only months later, run the risk of getting delayed software updates or no updates at all. even though htc said the one x will get jelly bean this month, who knows how long itll take for carriers to push that update through. by the way, remember that remote wipe hack that was discovered recently? it has been proven that exploit can be used against a number of phones that arent made by samsung. my personal phone, the htc sensation is at risk, but do you think ill ever get a security update? i dont.&quot;</text>

    <text>this phone just gets me nervous how people can still buy a phone that looks the same 3 years in a row, just longer, and nothing new from the iphone 4s, is it just to show people that you are cool that you bought a new phone. android s3 and note 2 blows this phone out of the water into the sand. i littereally cant see anything that the iphone 5 is better at, nothing</text>

    <text>absolute rubbish phone. waited 4 hours and it was pretty much same as 4s. returned it to apple and staff looked at me as if ii can't be because its 'so good'. apple maps is rubbish, i travel a lot on business and use google maps to find places but can't find anywhere now.  people will start switching to competitors because apple isn't the 'only' phone on the market</text>

    <text>'phenomenal' canadian response to iphone 5    the big three wireless carriers in canada, telus corp., bell canada and rogers communications ltd., announced that pre-orders for the new iphone 5 were rolling in at a staggering rate.  according to mobilesyrup.com, telus reported increased sales by &quot;orders of magnitude over previous years.&quot; the company credited the &quot;excellence&quot; of its pre-order system for at least part of the surge. bell, not to be outdone, said that interest in the iphone 5 had been so strong it had to close down its pre-orders. as far as it was concerned, its customers were drawn to &quot;the countrys largest lte network and unique services like our leading mobile tv offering.&quot;</text>

    <text>been using iphone 5 for 2, days, cool phone and very user friendly..but always have to keep it boxed cause scratches easily...and i completely disagree with the speed taste against s3,a rooted s3 with jb and also an active ad killer app,s3 is fastest, totally lag free... i also saw the speed test in youtube,, i wonder that s3 had updated or not. trust me,android can be very best, unless you follow some rule, for an example,, if you don't clear your ram and kill applications on every 10 minutes, you will find at least 20 to 30 applications constantly running in the back,, which is awesome and ridiculous at the same time. to me,i love both of my phones, they r good and efficient, because i run them efficiently..</text>

    <text>i'm an iphone user since 2008 and i must say i'm pretty satisfied. however as time goes by, and as smartphones continue to give extrat or additional features like gigantic screens offered by android phones, i made a switch to android(although my gf satyed with her 4s) i admit i got lost on how to use the android festures, but eventually got used to it. one thing i really noticed is how scrolling is not as smooth as when ypu used iphone 4s for the first time. i tried researching on how to root the phone (sorry i'm really no a geek) but find it hard to understand the steps, also i use a mac. in fairness, both platforms has it's pros and cons-android for superphone/computer like functionality and iphone for simplicity of use and it's responsiveness. as for os update, you can rest assured the iphone you invested money with will have an os update as long as it's supported, that i don't know about android phones, unless you use a custom rom.</text>

    <text>the next web: iphone review    conclusion for the article:  the iphone 5 is the most capable and carefully designed smartphone ever. there is no other on the market that combines the best screen in the world with a completely custom processor and a wafer thin chassis to produce an lte-fast device with industry standard or better battery life.  the only way that the iphone 5 could be unimpressive is if youre the kind of person that thinks that the more aftermarket fiberglass fins that a car has, the faster it will go.  this device is a tour de-force performance of a company firing on all cylinders. the internal components work together in concert to deliver one of the most pleasant and powerful experiences of any ever produced. if youre reading these sentences and rolling your eyes, then you probably have an allergy to hyperbole, and i understand because i do too. but this isnt hyperbole, it isnt exaggeration.</text>

    <text>i can't but writing opinion! recently i've visited several apple store(s) in uk, &amp; i found all the iphone 5 have gotten scratched on their edge after 3/4 days of used in the shop. whether it's black or white every iphone 5 has scratched there, mostly invisible in white version.  ...&amp; i really shocked! they could do better with same material by using the silver aluminium unibody both on the black &amp; white versions. &amp; obviously that would be better looking too. or they could make the shiny silver edge on black version.  however, i've a macbook pro, had a iphone 4s but definitely i'm not an apple fanboy rather than a great tech-fan. caused, i've already used some htc android(s) &amp; wp as well. couple of years ago i've used some nokia smartphones too.  from my experience, in terms of anodized aluminium unibody htc is the best, they've made the standard of anodized aluminium unibody by making legendary htc legend, desire hd, desire s, 7 mozart, one s(***) and so on.... apple could learn from them. really this kind of fault is not acceptable from an company like apple :( how could they make this mistake when they're making colourful anodized aluminium unibody beautiful ipods since from very beginning.  ***at very beginning htc one s had some chipping issue but that is solved. i'm using one s for 3 months &amp; didn't get scratched yet, hopefully won't in future.  n.b: i don't like any cheap looking plastic made samsung phone. &amp; definitely i'll go for iphone 5 but not sure about which colour i'll get.</text>

    <text>had the 3gs, 4 and 4s. the 5 was quite a letdown - very little innovation, very minor upgrade from the 4s. the build quality was superb at first glace, but the phone is too light - yes, lighter is not always better. soon you will realize the 5 is much more prone to scratches than the 4/4s. the anodized aluminum chipping issue is very real and your new 5 will look older than my 4s in no time. i'm fine with the ios6, i even like the new map - the 3d view is just spectacular. i decided to jump for android a few days after playing with the 5. the galaxy s3 is a great piece of device, though i'm still struggling with the ui after a couple days of usage. i would say if you are like me, a long time iphone user who wants something more refreshing than a longer screen, switch to android for a year. samsung did a fantastic job with the s3. give it a try, if you don't like it, switch back to iphone next year, and you know you did not miss much from the 5.</text>

    <text>hey guys so i thought i should post up a review of the iphone 5, from my short experience with it so far.  i cant review all of it as i have only had a few hours (8) with it.  first of all.. after reading all the scratch issues i was very worried. i ordered a black one so it should have been even worse than a white one.  i can confirm my phone is sparkling.. black, not a scratch or dent - anywhere (- yet!!! lol). (also, my partners one is white, and hers was also perfect).  so body is perfect and black looks amazing in person. i had the 4s in white so i went with the black this time. (and my girl went with the white so we just got different  colours - anyway..)  1. its now a perfect weight. doesnt feel too heavy anymore like the 4s was. i didnt mind the weight of the 4s, but now i have seen and felt the lightness, its unbelievable.  2. the general speed. my goodness this phone is fast. just when you thought the speed of the ui and apps were already as fast as possible, apple proves me wrong.  flicking about the apps, is just butter smooth now. amazing how seamless it is really have not used anything like this before. no stutter, not even a hint of it. perfect speed. maybe in the future new apps and redesigned (fancy) ui stuff will slow this down.. maybe not? its very snappy.  i can open a game so much faster than before. i can close it faster than before. awesome.  3. display. it really is nicer now. i am not an expert by any means, but i have looked at a lot of screens in my time with phones, (all iphones, htc desire/one x, sgs 2, nokia e6) but this is very nice. blacks look blacker. colours look more rich. very happy with new screen. videos fit perfectly.  4. earphones. they are now very nice. sound richer and bass is not tinny anymore, still stays clear when you turn it up. what else you want with from the oem earpods.  5. build quality. it feels like a piece of jewelery in your hand. amazing finish.  6. internet speed. this is not a reason i bought the phone for. i just wanted the lightness and screen, speed. i never had seen lte in action before so it never fazed me. my goodness this is the most important feature of the phone to me.  some tests i did. on my iphone 4s using speedtest.net's app, i got a speed of around 3-8mbps dl, and around 0.65 mbps ul.  from the same spot with my new iphone 5, i ran the test again. brace yourself! lol..  dl - 52.74 mbps ul - 27.48 mbps  i dont know if this is great, good bad whatever.. but for me, this is amazing. it smashes my broadband adsl 2+, which is hard to comprehend.  7. wifi speed. it now connects to wifi at greater distance which for me now means the whole of my house. and its speeds are quick like its hooked up via ethernet. very impressed with this also.  8. battery. normally with my previous lipo battery iphones they are at their best on full charge/dsicharge cycles and after about 2-3 weeks.  im on my first charge now, the whole time i have had lte on, wifi on, 5 email accounts, and whatever else, location services weather etc.  i have been listening to music for an hour, i have had the phone hooked up via bluetooth to the car for about 2 hours and had wifi lte tethering set up at the same time (for about an hour) on my partners ipad. i have been checking it every 5 minutes (new phone). i have run speed tests, and in general been using the crap out of it with many things running at the same time (syncing drop box)(as well as the screen on), and even downloaded heaps of apps.  it is now 1am and came off charge at around 7:00pm. (so about 5h 45 minutes so far) battery has 69% left.  this leads me to believe that at almost maximum discharge (bar playing a hardcore game) it wil last at at least 15-20 hours.  when i start using the phone normally after the excitement calms down, i expect easy 24-36 hours. easy.  my cons, would be that not all the apps fit perfectly yet, and a lot of people would mention maps as an issue, but i have used it, it was accurate, and the 3d thing is off the hook!   anyway.. any problems arise with my phone, i will definitely be back here to post.</text>

    <text>warning to all user who wanted to downgrade their ios 6 version to ios 5. do not try to do so as ios 6 is still a beta version. what's shown on the youtube for ios 6 downgrading are proof to be untrue. it will only give u errors &amp; kill ur device. keep what u have now and wait for apple to resolve the problem. wait for apple officially announcement.</text>

    <text>proof that iphone users are hypocrites: until 4s they hated on all of these phones with bigger screens (4&quot; or above) saying it's unnecessary/too big to carry around/can't fit in a pocket blah blah blah &amp; as i predicted, as soon as apple launches a 4&quot; device all of the sudden they shut their mouth &amp; it's a new trend now? lol you people are pathetic!</text>

    <text>apple does not need powerfull cpu/gpu to run so any argument is null and void..iphone does have some things missing but i have accepted them ..i was bashing apple 2007-2011  but tried it and loved it..  folk asking what is special about iphone and i say its got top quality components ie microphone/speaker/cam/screen/mains plug and so on..it is consistant in use all the time everytime all the time..it is simple to use and taking a photo and emailing it is special,,it takes the photo and animates it showing how it attached to the email.it shows you in simple terms the photo being embedded into the email..  i find daily stress levels with a smartfone erradicated with iphone as it just carrys on doing the job lag free,stress free and simple and lovely.  i hated iphone last year now i think its spotless..i dont need a map to find my way round uk for gods sake its well signposted..in seconds i can be watching tv then putting in calender entry then setting alarm with no stress lag or crash or force close,,over and over again with 64 apps open..try and crash an iphone ,push it over and over again and it just keeps doing it with no lag or crash.  the iphone is an object of lust and the o/s just backs that up with flawless operation..thats whats so good about iphone.</text>

    <text>no matter what iphone's freak loyal customers say about samsung, one thing must be remembered..... there will always be some critics who will criticize the good thing. no matter how you provide good things to the people if it is good ...then it should be appraised. iphone is good i appraise it, samsung made good products than iphone so, i will also appraise it. talking about patent and all things will die soon. only good thongs will be remembered. if the manufacturer of first computer thought same like apple did they could do a miles long patent objections on various computer manufacturer company ! couldn't they !</text>

    <text>it's not about being ''haters'' or ''fanboys''... it's the honest truth. why would you buy a phone from a company that wants to control everything? even the rectangle shape itself??? they've made great innovations a few years ago, but now... what's new? they spend their time with frivolous lawsuits and anything new on their devices is ''borrowed'' from android... i'm sorry, but that's the truth.</text>

    <text>i am an apple lover too. i used the 3gs and i must say it's the best phone i ever used back than. but soon i realize it not worth supporting apple. apple is what it is today because of us consumer but sadly it has take things for granted,riding on the success of it's iphone by launching a so call new model every year that has nothing new. the iphone 5 is no difference than the 4. simply by adding an a6 processor and a slimmer,metallic look apple inc is pushing and saying it's the best iphone ever. seriously?? yes. it's a great phone but isn't this what apple has already launched years ago ? where is the improvement ? 1 whole year just to improve on the processor and an extra 0.5&quot; screen ? again no microsd slot ? to make matter worst apple changed the pin connector. basically whatever accessories you have in the past must be changed too.(isn't that blood sucking). rest assured what garbage apple launch will sell.that's what apple is depending on now. yes their brand and no longer their innovation.</text>

    <text>one thing ios is popular for is it's apps selection, and even if available on other platforms, tend to be optimized and slightly better.  pc mag: one android user's iphone app envy    &quot;most of the year, i'm an android user. my personal phone is an android device, as are most of the gadgets around here. but for about two months each year, i'm an iphone and ipad tester, and that's when i get horribly envious. you see, it's the apps. especially the games.  after four years of intense competition, the quality and availability of leading third-party iphone apps still beats android, even though android phones have much greater market share. we've seen it in study after study: more people own android phones, but developers prefer ios. apple's phones are easier to develop for, with less fragmentation, less piracy, and a higher rate of developers getting paid for their efforts.&quot;</text>

    <text>hey guys i will tell you what apple does  check out this   it seems they have been planning on flexible screen for their phone and products. in the u.s.a they already applied for a patent for those shape of screen design and some posibilities  check this out too   samsung is planning on its first flexible screen galaxy smart phone next year and already made some prototypes(you can find easily on youtube)  in conclusion, apple has not much idea and technology on the flexible screen and just draws some design ideas for a patent. when samsung or the other company release smartphone with this screen, apple may sue them and pretends it was their idea and technology long time ago lol  seriously, i wanna ask you something...  do you really think apple has a lead to &quot;the newest technology&quot;?, if so, based on what?, based on because it is an apple?..  i am definitely sure that the more you know about technology about smartphone stuffs and eletronics, the less interests in apple products.  they are only good at marketing and keeping brainwashing their loyal customers as well as tricky and vicious strategy to sue other companies interrupting the true technology</text>

    <text>200 reasons of not to buy iphone 5  1. poor maps 2. small screen 3. wifi problem 4. too prone to scratches 5. unusual lines while trying to type a message 6. camera with an unusual purple color on the pics taken 7. no more access to youtube 8. no more access to google accounts 9. no more google search engine 10. have to use a silly case to protect its very fragile body 11. same old boring ui 12. no nothing new feature but a silly thing called lightning for charging the phone and a panorama for pics 13. no turn by turn 14. no expandle memory 15. no video calls over cellular 16. no flash for streaming videos 17. escaping light from the phone 18. too light , seems like a toy when hold 19. no xvid/divx 20. too expensive for a half baked os 21.  to be continued.. stay tuned :-)</text>

    <text>played with the actual phone at the apple training.  looks jsut like the iphone 4/4s but slightly taller.  with ios6 on the older phones i dont see how this phone is so amazing..... i really dont.  how ever it is a money maker for our business due to all teh apple fans.  but if people ask me for my recommendation it is going to be the s3.  hands down.</text>

    <text>i bought iphone 4 two years ago and it is durable it looks new cause i'm over-protective to my belongings. and last year, i bought my wife iphone 4s 32gb she seems satiated with it. and next month i want to buy iphone 5 for my younger sister. one thing i like about iphones is that you can get the update regardless how old is your phone. most of the android phone that came last didn't qualify for ics, i don't want to mention jelly bean only few did qualify. at same stage most have not received jb. because of that i will never use android phone. ios &amp; windows.</text>

    <text>why android update lag is a problem    the remote wipe flaw found in samsung devices apparently can wipe out any android device and also black out the sim card.  on wp8 or ios this would be solved by an update, however on android, it goes to manufacturers. samsung have sent an update, but others have not, leaving a very long lag between vulnerabilities and the software patch coming in time.</text>

    <text>anandtech: iphone 5 screen performance    wrapping up, the iphone 5 display is a whole quantum leap better than the display on the iphone 4.  contrast levels and light output have both been increased, and color performance is astonishing.  the full srgb gamut is present here, and color errors are remarkably low for a even a high end desktop display.  while many were hoping for a move to oled or some other screen innovation, this really is a huge step up that is very easy to quantify.  to put this in perspective, in the past few years i've reviewed probably 30-40 different displays, from pc monitors, to tvs to projectors.  not a single one, out of the box, can put up the gretag macbeth de numbers that the iphone can, and perhaps one projector (which listed for $20,000) can approach the grayscale and color accuracy out of the box.  apple obviously has very high control over what parts they use and what comes off their assembly lines.  i don't know if they are having the displays individually adjusted after they are assembled, or if the quality control is very strict, or if i just got a really remarkably lucky sample.  i do know that if tv and pc monitor vendors were able to provide displays that looked like this out of the box, professional calibrators would lose a good amount of business potentially. the new panel in the iphone 5 is simply remarkable in quality and if it were a pc monitor, i'd give it a gold award on the basis of it's performance..</text>

    <text>apple does make good devices. but truth be told, their prices are overrated!!! their devices are good but they dont deserve these huge prices. personally making an iphone 5 costs only $260. so why the hell should it be sold $1200??? i think samsung galaxy s3 is the best phone you can ever get with amazing functions and an incredibly good price. to hell with apple and their high prices.</text>

    <text>hater tactics.  iphone 4 launch - suddenly gripping a phone tightly to reduce signal, becomes a new thing lol.  then, after they waste all their breath dissing apple, in a stroke of genius apple releases iphone 4s, with exactly the same design, and the haters scratch their head. guess what, suddenly it's all about the glass. strangely, no one questioned the glass for the whole year when iphone 4 was using it.  iphone 5 - glass is replaced with aluminium, much more durable, smashes sgs3 (literally) in 3 separate drop test videos, and suddenly it's about itty bitty scratches. and also, suddenly scratching phone backing with keys is an acceptable thing lol. wonder why other phone launches don't have a &quot;let's scratch the hell out of the back&quot; test hahaha.  what happens when iphone 5s launches next year with same design?  the key to remember is that phones all come with good and bad, haters hate that apple gets so much press for good, yet fail to see that it also means it goes under scrutiny more, and the bad gets highlighted equally as much.  phones with much greater bad points get nowhere as much attention. if i wanted to, i could scour the net for every bad point about sgs3, make a list, and go trolling away. to me that's a waste of time, and frankly speaking i don't care to spend much time on things i don't like.  that's why i concentrate on the phone that i like, and its good points, which i can share with others.</text>

    <text>year in year out, apple haters wait for iphone launch as much as apple fans. they then tear it down, trying their best to find any small weakness.  any phone will have a weakness, but what the haters don't understand is that people don't buy phones based on a list of weaknesses, they buy phones on a list of wins. iphone sells a lot due to this, and so does sgs3 in the android world.  with that in mind, that's why i tend to concentrate on the good points of the iphone. if android manufacturers wants to sell more, they should do the same instead of obsessing over their rival. a little too late though, as they are now being blindsided by wp8.</text>

    <text>the best way to see if the iphone 5 scratches is to scratch the hell out of it inside the apple store    from the article:  &quot;does it suck to have scratches on something brand new that you just spent a lot of money on? hell yeah it does. but it's probably not a design flawnothing like antennagateand the aluminum back doesn't have the fragile beauty of the iphone 4 and 4s' glass back. swapping shattered glass for possibly scratched aluminum seems like a net positive.  and just look at the video above (which looks like it's filmed inside an at&amp;t store and not an apple store). that dude goes to town on the iphone 5 and it holds up surprisingly well, even after some pretty gnarly noises.&quot;</text>

    <text>i would love to see a brushed aluminum version of the iphone 5, would take care of the chipped paint issues.  wondering if this design was supposed to incorporate a memory metal frame, but apple wasn't able to get it into production in time and went with aluminum instead.  p.s 5 million units sold in one weekend is hardly a sinking ship.</text>

    <text>industry's eye is simply on iphone the default smartphone leader of the industry. no other phone commands such attention. year in year out, iphone this iphone that, and apple is going to die. simple fact is people buy iphone because they like it, when a much better phone comes, people will like that phone more and buy that one instead, simple.  for me, i buy the phone that serves me best, it could be the number 1 phone, or the number 5 phone. who cares, as long as it does what i want best.  someone who needs bbm will choose blackberry, even with the terrible market share. someone who wants an astounding camera could get the pureview 808 with its 40mp camera. most who like iphone is because it does many things in a simple intuitive way, with a good set of features. those who want customizability can go for android.  i would rather spend time talking about the good points of the phone i like, as opposed to constantly bashing phones that i don't.</text>

    <text>the iphone 5 is not perfect for sure, maps issue (hopefully improved soon, but alternatives are available), plus a chipping issue which needs to be verified by apple. apart from that, reviews and testimonials are nothing but glowing.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 low light comparisons in iceland    additionally, from the article:  &quot;late september in iceland is not a friendly place for any electronics... this is a time that puts your gear to the test whether you like it or not. just in the last 2 days of shooting here, i've had my iphone 5 covered in water from shooting near a waterfall and jordan has dropped his directly in the mud. both seem to be working fine.&quot;</text>

    <text>same report from macrumors    displaymate posts an extensive analysis of the new iphone 5 screen and also provides detailed comparisons against the iphone 4 and the samsung galaxy s iii.  they conclude that the iphone 5 represents the best smartphone screen they've tested.  &quot;based on our extensive lab measurements the iphone 5 has a true state-of-the-art accurate display  its not perfect and there is plenty of room for improvements (and competitors) but it is the best smartphone display we have seen to date based on extensive lab measurements and viewing tests.&quot;  in particular, they note that the iphone 5 has much lower screen reflections, a much higher image contrast and screen readability in high ambient lighting and notably improved color accuracy and picture quality.</text>

    <text>wow check out the squaretrade iphone 5 vs sgs3 toughness test. looks like the tables have turned this time round for samsung.    my only concern is that apple sorts out the chipping which is a cosmetic issue, toughness wise however, the iphone 5 can take a beating.</text>

    <text>consumer reports iphone 5 review.  bottom line:  the iphone 5 fulfills its promise as a notable improvement over its fine predecessor, the iphone 4s, and belongs in the first rank of smart phones   by boosting screen size, thinning its profile, and adding 4g lte access, among other features, his newest iphone shows every sign of being the most compelling yet.</text>

    <text>as a vzw employee i just wanna say one thing.  if i had a quarter for every android i had to replace under the 1 yr warrenty i'd be a millionare. if i had 1 million for every iphone i had to replace id be broke.  obviously apple is behind in technology and processor and technical junk, but fact of matter is that the adverage customer doesnt care about that they just want a reliable phone that they can use and that doenst have to be plugged in all the time.  dont get me wrong android is a good product as well but in my opinion i feel more comfortable selling the iphone over android to any customer especially first time users.</text>

    <text>i am surely going to buy this phone in october when probably they would get the quality issue sorted out. and why i am buying this, not that i love it but i will get it free of cost with renewing my contract which singtel told me i can renew without any top up after i completed just under 18 months. i have already replaced my previous iphone 4 and ipad 2 with galaxy tab 7.7. but only problem is i will never get jelly bean on 7.7. and that is a deal breaker as it is as smooth as ios. anyway planing to carry iphone 5 + tab 7.7 (which is smaller and thinner then ipad but excellent form to carry on hand easily for longer hours while on move. but if one has to seriously pay the full amount to get the iphone 5 (no contract) i would wonder how many they would sell. iphone for its high price never was a success in the world two most populous country where you hardly see any organized mobile contract in place. andriod being a better os but is so heavily fragmented that after spending so much on high end phone (spent 888sgd on tab 7.7) you do not expect to get any latest os (like jelly bean) upgrade after a year or less.</text>

    <text>no, don't buy. there are reports many new iphones are damaged from the factory with scuffs and scratches. the new connector does not fit your accessories. pay lots for an ugly adaptor no thanks. small screen. too restrictive about where you buy music, apps etc. apple want to be payed for every little thing. they are not the only company with a good app store any more.</text>

    <text>android is actually fantastic in concept. and even in philosophy. the problem is that the implementation of the manufacturers leaves a lot to be desired, which is probably why google merged with motorola, as even google conceded that like apple, a great android product would be through control over both hardware and software.</text>

    <text>in my opinion we are at a critical point for smartphones. ios will probably maintain steady sales, but this may result in unchanged market share or even a reduction. wp8 however, will be the biggest winner at android's expense with people switching wanting the benefits of ios, but not fom apple, with nokia and htc probably leading the way. samsung will have to do more than just the ativ if it wants a stake in the new wp8 world, or risk losing back share it won previously from nokia.</text>

    <text>people.... please stop trolling or bashing in this forum. it isn't polite. some people like to use the iphone for ease of usage. remember, only a small percentage are those you call as tech savvy, therefore suitable to use android.  in the iphone forums, i don't see much complaints as regards to os crashing, lagging, apps freezing.  unlike those you see at android forums... people encounter real problems after sometime of use.  with regards to resale value... here in the philippines...  2nd hand iphones still get a good price... while android phones  gets sold really cheap.  its easy to get a standard update of ios for all iphones.  while android phones don't even get a decent os update due to diversity of models &amp; makes.  so everything really boils down to ease of functionality &amp; usage.</text>

    <text>got to play with the iphone 5 today as it starting selling in dubai a couple of days ago. i confirm the the corners and back get chipped and scratched easily,phone is still small for me. camera and the rest of the software pales in comparison to my lumia 900 not even the 920 which will eat it alive. overall an ok but boring phone. maybe for a new user it's great. for someone who have used all the iphones and stopped with the 4s when there started being better alternatives in the market it's not an alternative for me anymore. well for now the phone is ok but will have a rough time with the competition from galaxy 3,lumia 900&amp;920, and even the htc 8x.  and the funny part is every part of the that apple claimed is the only one or the best is getting disapproved fact by fact. what happened apple. hope the guy who slept in the street for a week gets his times worth. for me someone who can do that is a person who needs to get a life and a job.</text>

    <text>autospies: first iphone samples in not so perfect light conditions    from the article:  &quot;kudos to apple for the improvements and for what's in development.  the iphone 5 is definitely the best low-light cell phone camera yet.  we're interested to see the new nokia performance but that is not available to us yet.  remember, megapixel stats don't tell the whole story on cameras.  real-life samples do.  the android cameras brag about high megapixels but in our tests they are no match for the iphone. especially when the lighting gets dicey.&quot;</text>

    <text>ok, we consider that you seeking for the best phone in the world. you know that this phone must have these features: less than 9 mm thickness, smart os, display density more than 300, display size 4 inch or more, camera 8 mp or more, gps, gyro, compass, wlan, more than 8 hours talk time, weight less than 120 g! beleive it or not there is only one phone in the world that has all these together: iphone 5. and all of these are the 'hardware' specs not the software. you can figure out this on gsmarena phone finder.</text>

    <text>im an apple fan and owning iphone 4s, sorry to said that the 5 is disappointing, other brands having quad core from long time ago and apple still on dual core also others having 1.5 speed while apple stays behind 1.2ghz, and what is this battery!!! also the design only taller, if u want to make 4inch just do it in 2 ways vertical and horzintal, also the 4s is anti scratch from both sides and its the only mobile having scratch resistant from the back, iphone 5 back to make it plastic like others, apple dying after jobs death ( the mastermind )</text>

    <text>slashgear iphone 5 review    competition between mobile platforms keeps the industry moving and innovating. that can often present itself as a surfeit of innovation: feature upon feature, piled high in an all-singing, all-dancing device. right now, the iphone 5 has the best balance of everyday usability and performance, without the distraction of functionality that is clever but unintuitive. its an area in which apple excels, and its the reason the iphone 5 is one of the best smartphones on the market today.</text>

    <text>metro review of iphone 5    on paper, the iphone 5 may appear to offer more of the same. while it doesnt deviate from apples previous iphone template too much, once you have the thing in your hand it sweeps you away. throw in an improved siri, the panorama camera function and, yes, those flipping earpods and you have a five-star iphone 5. it may not be the biggest smartphone out there, but it remains the classy leader of its field.</text>

    <text>i'm not an apple fan @all and i actually try to deter potential iph buyers and convince them to get a droid but i have no doubt the iph5 will do brilliantly in terms of sales despite the underwhelming features and specs. but more importantly, i absolutely love the look of the phone, when the nokia n8 came out i told my friend(who owns the iph4) that the matal body looks way better than the iph4/s glass back and naturally he gave me a lecture on how much better the glass back was but i knw right now he is telling ppl how gr8 the metal back is and i agree. the designs of all the previous iphones were lame to say the least but this new 1 is great and far better than the sgs3. the only 2 designs i find superior are that of the razr's and the unibody of the lumia 920/900.</text>

    <text>this article just shows the disadvantage of using aluminum. it's a soft metal, scratches easily and extremely sensitive to a simple drop. putting a rubberized plastic case in it will just make things worst because dust that get through the casing will definitely leave ugly scars. what a cheap choice of material. kevlar or polycarbonate is still better.</text>

    <text>to me it's just in sgsiii league. the problem is sgsiii is 4 months old and we'll be getting more advanced smartphones in the near future. but right now it's probably the best time to buy this phone. with apple's pricing policy, it wont be a good buy in 3-4 months. right now it's just a little bit overpriced.</text>

    <text>ok ok i admit it... i actually went n checked out the iphone5 and gotta say my negative initial thoughts about the ip5 after checking it out in person are now much worse ..the phone itself  despite the small physical differences actually in my opinion is quite bland, the back looks nice but far from great and honestly in my opinion lost its premium feel over the ip4/4s although a wiser choice of material... also the lighter weight again imo makes it feel dare i say cheap. it honestly looks kinda like an old school sony ericsson that could have been released years ago. the 'new' screen despite being thinner i see no difference in quality, scrolling through app screens, launching apps, using the net  again dont see any noticeable improvements in speed over the 4s... i kinda get it if people are wanting to swap to a simpler os fair enough but anyone who currently owns the ip4s or 4 for that matter and are gunna run out and spend serious cash on the ip5 need to get their heads checked unless maybe your getting it as a free upgrade or are going to jailbreak it to use it to its full potential.. after checking it out i seriously cannot wait for proper reviews to start popping up..cant wait! again it truly makes think.. if this thing wasnt branded with 'iphone' or had the apple logo how popular it would have been imo the one good thing about the iphone 5 is i will be receiving one as a free upgrade soon and as soon as i get it its going straight on ebay and im gunna make me some good coin!</text>

    <text>after looking through the specs.... to be honest.... quite disappointed. 640 x 1136 pixels? is this a midrange phone? how does apple expect to compete against hox and s3? i don't understand. not sure how the a6 performs in comparison to the exynos processor on s3. might as well look more into it. most disappointed by the battery life!! 1424 mah is abysmal. never heard of an iphone that is battery swap-able.  good luck i5 users...</text>

    <text>a friend of mine bought one.  it's incredibly lite, but he's already got a couple scratches in the back because of it rubbing on a metal snap when he stuffed it in his blue jean pocket.  so get a cover because the alum back is not durable.  it's sooo much faster than the iphone 4s, but why is there still no external memory slot?  oh yea, get on the cloud (what a crock - like that's more convenient.)  big criticism is the apple map app.  it sucks big time.  can't find any of my favorite restaurants around me here in bangkok.  don't take my word for it being crap, plenty of articles say the same thing:  i don't think this would have happened were steve jobs still around.  he would have forgone the corporate profits because it was more important to have pride in what his company produced.  he knew the profits would come.  this is not a good omen for the company in my opinion.</text>

    <text>a word about the lines. they were only long outside certain stores. a friend went to the store this morning and walked out with the phone within half an hour. so don't let the lenght of the line fool you. *** now about the phone - the 4s (with ios5) still looks and feels better. iphone 5 seems oddly rectangular with hardly any 'noticable' difference (other than the weight and longer screen). *** unless you belong to the crowd which jimmy kimmel interviewed, you are not going to be impressed.</text>

    <text>i think it is hilarous people are so excited over a phone that literally offers nothing new to an already pre existing long standing market.  they make such a big deal about this product for what? the apple logo. you fan people can take your iphones.. i of course appreciate the design of apple products, always have but i am not the type of person who purchases electronics for fashion statements.  their computers are great for multimedia tasks but that is literally about it. their phones are just lacking badly now and are pretty much far behind.  it is ironic apple sued samsung quote &quot;they stole our shape.&quot; when samsung has been far ahead regardless. so what has apple done now? they just copied everyone by their definition, releasing a phone that literally is no better than any others. god who cares apple your &quot;shape&quot; really...? anyway samsung has been killing it, they had phones with these specs 2 years ago.  their phones are the best in my opinion, people simply buy the iphone because they don't know any better. mainly just like their computers.  they either need it simply because of its restricted apps/software for some certain need of theirs or because they just want to follow the herd, this phone literally is a fashion accessory at this point in time for the most part.  i truly and utterly feel bad whoever stupidly waited in line for two days for this old phone.  looking back at how many models of the iphone they have released in such a short span of time is quite pathetic, at least samsung's phones have been very noticeable in comparison with one another development wise. the iphones are literally barely any different every time around.  nothing special about this phone, so it should not be treated as such. when apple releases a phone that is better than every phone on the market then i will care.</text>

    <text>dont mean to bash at iphone...was planning to upgrade to one but the launch put me off. $199 for an iphone? a big joke defo. and the size you would expect a proportional size. app has gone dull...an extra row of icons? not impressed and the bugs with ios 6...list goes on.  the 'wow' factor of iphone is gone or died. iphone 4s still holds that title. good luck to apple hope they sort out the bugs they have created.  obviously apple only looking for sales not the costumers needs.  now im defo buying note 2.</text>

    <text>i am not a fanboy of anykind i concidered i5 as an option but not anymore ios6 is a disaster i prefer wm8 and android any time i am depending on nfc nowadays its not there in the i5 i am travelling alot as for my company i need accurate maps not in the i5 i enjoy listening to radio programs not in the i5 l have lots of documents includes hd video so i need a large amount of storage not in i5 the max is un-upgradable 64gb where in many android and wp8 u can insert sd cards so i usualy take 2-4 64gb sdcards with me for presenting the documents yes iphone &quot;was&quot; great but not anymore. and for the people stating its only for rich people: for gods sake its only 700$ not a really expensive device and also rich people use and advance with technology ios6 looks exactly as ios4 that i used before in my 3gs and i used 4s a row if icons is not innovation look at nokia lumia 920 now thats innovation in matter of fact its a techno revoloution and android is the best os in my opinion if u say its laggy ill admit but ios is stable with no features its just a calling texting ipod touch..dont take my words seriously just my opinion and observation</text>

    <text>the iphone 5 is the evolution from iphone 4s. many of the buyers will be first time iphone users, or upgrade from older models. some will upgrade from iphone 4s but this will not be the bulk as ios 6 gives them most of the features anyway.  there will be many buyers from android, or first time buyers, or iphone 3gs/4 owners, blackberry owners etc, so to them iphone 5 is a fantastic buy.</text>

    <text>the iphone 5 is disappointing and i can't believe this is what people waited for. this phone made no real advancements in the world of cellular devices. this iphone pretty much is playing catch-up to the competition. only real advancements is all around speed, which is sad. people will still buy it because its apple and they have been dying for and upgrade but apple can do better and consumers expect better.  samsung is on top and imagine when their next big phone comes out? it will create a bigger margin of seperation from the technology in an iphone.</text>

    <text>with the current iphone 5 price (529) people should get what they paid for which is:  quad core proportional designed phone new tech (nfc) stunning new design  these are just a few of the price of which other competitors offer on their new phones. apple should be offering these new stuff to their loyal costumers and new ones.  also people are expecting the new iphone should top the new phones around like in speed or multitasking capabilities.  feel sorry for the people who are going to buy this phone. you are getting less tech for the amount.</text>

    <text>i understand the s3 is a good device and everyone could go back and forth comparing their phone as to which one is best but the bottom line is this..which phone is well built, is easy to use and have an awesome appstore?..the iphone. i had an android device before and found the google play store lacking in quality apps from well known developers and movies to buy. yes with android you could download emulators and play them but playing old games could get stale and besides most of the emus you could get on your ipad and iphone once it's jail broken. i'm not crapping on android because i still love the os but right now until they fully het things together i'm sticking with apple.</text>

    <text>around the world, went shopping spree iphone 5, a media report about the next record sales. however, it turns out that the new baby of the cupertino company is not such a revelation.  yesterday, news spread around the world suggesting that the new a6 processor installed in the next generation iphone is much faster than the chip, in which the features of the popular samsunggalaxy s3. on the evidence presented to confirm the results of the benchmark geekbench, which smartphone has reached 1601 points result.  although the advantage over the galaxy s3 was small, as in the case of this phone we are talking about 1,560 points as a result, it is apple fans have another argument proving the superiority of their favorite companythe korean competition. it should be noted, however, that it is a dual-core snapdragon s3 (site editors ubergizmo on s3 with 2-core processor was able to get the result of 1465 points), so if a6 chip quad-core iphone 5 is only slightly faster than the dual-core s3, this newchild apple may not be such a revolution, which was expected.</text>

    <text>what's so big deal about iphone5. apple keeps everyone in suspense for so long and that only leads to higher and higher expectations. and eventually they announce a phone ways below public expectations.  that's a stupid company policy. consumers don't wait, they are just giving away their market share to the ingenious samsung that continues to upgrade its os and manipulates with design and screen size.  samsung gives what consumers want, while iphone wants consumers to want what they have. i don't think apple can carrying itself further after iphone5. what have you? iphone5g, iphone5s? by that time, we will have a superandroid that does lots of things.</text>

    <text>just a common sense replay , i5 550e+ while htc one x and s3 are about the same price  of 500e , except the fact both of them are far better then i5 , sup with logics lol? as for ios ... i5 is limited as a bottle while android is open source .. i mean just check xda about one x there's a ton of mods, kernels, roms for s3 and 1x , as for speed and response idk about you guys but i doubt ios will be ever faster then cynogen mod 10 ( tested it myself, its even faster then your fingers .. simply amazing .. + it's only leaked jelly bean rom, imagine what can you do with original when it gets out , not to mention what will devs do with their hacky hands lol ) btw as for batterry im quiet sure ios can't last long as how much can one x on arhd rom ( screan time on , 6hrs here screan time for me atm with 57% left. beat that.) anyway i5 is a good device if you're looking for an avarege daily use device. would be nice if i5 gets quadrant, 7.4k for me uv'd and oced :p.</text>

    <text>what the heck guys? have u ever have your hands on an iphone in real life? i have sgs iii and iphone 4s, yeah watching videos is always a fun on s3, but with iphone 5 i think that won't remain much of a difference! the most important thing of all is smoothnes, even with jelly bean installed on my galaxy s3 (leaked one), it is far from perfect, where iphone has been since many many years, and second most important thing is the apps, they are taking full advantage of iphone's software and hardware because developers just need to optimise it with one single phone that's why they can make it as good as possible for iphone, but in androids optimising apps, to be used on 1000 phones isn't possible at all, so apps are a disappointment after all, yeah s3 is ahead in many terms but overall iphone 5 is an overall winner for me because a phone is gonna be a phone so gaming experience, video viewing must be what iphone is offering and if we need such big screens we got something named as tablets, buy 'em!</text>

    <text>in my though, apple has to go in dark room and think about os. i should say hardware is good, everyone has now a days. but the os support is very limited. simple things, you can't upload photos, videos, song without connecting to itunes. why? if you want to upload pictures copied/updated by dropbox/google drive etc, you have very limited. as these files are not accessible. why? bluetooth is improved, but does it support data share? if no, why? why they introduced nano sim??? does micro sim or normal sim will make it very big???</text>

    <text>i don't understand why you guys surprised of the 2 millions pre-order so far.. this large screen (compared to previous iphones and not other flagships in the market) is all what apple needed to make its largest success ever. the 4s has broken all records with the same size of iphone 4. you may calculate iphone sales from this equation: iphone 5 salaes= iphone 4s salaes * ((4.0&quot; - 3.5&quot;)/0.1) if u understand what i mean</text>

    <text>just to let y'all know, whilst the iphone 5 is probably a decent phone, you can get a helluva lot more for a helluva lot less: htc one x and samsung galaxy s3 are both cheaper by around 20 at least and are vastly superior phones, both in terms of benchmarking results, app cost and screen size, the s3 has an sd card slot and 50gb dropbox whilst the one x has ~30gb on board memory and 25gb dropbox.  like i said, iphones are not bad by any means, they are fantastically reliable and look very nice, they are just madly overpriced for a phone that isn't even top of the range, especially considering the horribly limited customisation of a device that you pay 500+ for.</text>

    <text>this is the best iphone yet as it has siri improved, 4 inch screen is not bad, good picture quality and voice quality on facetime and passbook is massive this is a must buy device but the ones who are saying that iphone 4 was better no they all are you don't about specs really i have used iphone 4s. in that siri is too bad. iphone 4 didn't have siri only 4s had. the main difference in iphone 3gs and iphone 4 (not 4s) is - 1. facetime 2. good looks 3. front camera (for facetime)  4s was far better than 3gs as it had siri but this iphone 5 is one of the best iphones ever and ios 6 (best os) and it has arm 15 and is the first device to introduce it and apple a6 cortex chip</text>

    <text>iphone is a good phone and the best iphone is the 4s without a doubt. we cant blame ppl on liking and buying this new iphone as most of them are apple loyalist or they're just in the trend. i was thinking of upgrading (from android) to iphone but when they released this new one its just disappointment. you would expect a far more superior phone in terms of 'tech' and 'featured apps'. people will disagree on me on this one but its true. check the other phones' specs and features and compare it to iphone 5. 500+ you should get what you paid for. you'll only pay for the looks (casing) of the phone but u get less from the inside. $199 starting price? where can i find such a thing?</text>

    <text>read the reviews, they have now started coming in.  cnet review:  - &quot;the screen size lengthening is subtle: but, like the retina display, you're going to have a hard time going back once you've used it.&quot; - &quot;lte, in my tests, ran anywhere from 10 to 20 [mbps], which is up to twice as fast as my wireless router's connection at home.&quot; - &quot;still pictures taken while recording video aren't shot using the normal 8-megapixel web cam; they're screen captures of the video itself. the aspect ratio is different, and the image quality's a bit weaker.&quot; - &quot;callers i reached via speakerphone noticed a crisper, clearer call on the iphone 5 versus the iphone 4s.&quot; - &quot;the phone's lasted roughly the whole day each day, unplugging around 8 a.m. and engaging in a mix of calling, web surfing, video playback, downloading, game playing, facetime calling over wi-fi and lte, and even a little 4g lte hot spot use via my macbook air.&quot;</text>

    <text>i think iphone 5 if it comes out in the next version should equip with home button finger scan and the nfc. if possible it should also equip with the censor based hand wipe (1meter distance) so that the user can wipe up or downor left or right without touching on the screen.</text>

    <text>apple always seem to leave out some key features from their products.  why not full european lte 800\1800\2600. this is a no no to me. most people buy the phone for 2 years not for 3 months.  instead of going in to slimmest contest give people proper battery power that will last 3-4 days. everything under 10mm is slim enough.</text>

    <text>to get down to specifics, the iphone 5 is the worlds slimmest smartphone, with a 7.6 mm anodized aluminium body, which is 18% thinner and 20% lighter than the iphone 4s, rounded off with diamond-cut chamfered edges and glass inlays.  the retina display measures 4 inches, and boasts even more pixels than the iphone 4s. the taller screen enables you to still use the iphone with one hand, but now gives better picture quality on the larger retina display, including widescreen hd video, all five days of your calendar, and just generally more on view.  as far as speed is concerned, the iphone 5 supports ultrafast wireless standards such as lte and dc-hsdpa, with its unique, single-radio lte solution that provides all the speed while remaining slim enough to fit into the thin casing. wi-fi support comes with dual-band 802.11n up to mbps.  the new a6 chip boasts twice the cpu and graphics performance of the iphone 4s.  the isight camera has been redesigned, and despite being 25% smaller than the iphone 4s camera, includes a new panorama feature for panoramic images of up to 28 megapixels. the camera features a sapphire crystal lens cover that is thinner and more durable than standard glass.  the new lightning dock connector is all-digital, and features an adaptive interface that only uses the signals that are required by each device. its also reversible.  the iphones qualities as a music player have also not been forgotten, with new apple earpods, which have been completely redesigned from the iconic shape of the famous white earphones, and are said to now have a more natural fit, increased durability, and the sort of acoustic quality usually associated with high-end earphones. improvements have also been made to the quality of phone call audio for both the person who is talking and the person who is listening, including a new beam-forming, directional microphone system.</text>

    <text>very recently apple gained an important victory against one of its biggest competitors  samsung. this week the tech giant won another battle. a munich based court decided that motorola mobility was guilty of infringing an apple held patent.  the patent in question is referred to as overscroll bounce or rubber-banding and is used in interface animation. for the moment there will be no explicit measures taken towards motorola because apple has first to request the ban on motorola products that use the technology.  patent expert florian muller, who initially posted the information on the fosspatents blogs, claimed that apple will surely be willing to ensure a german sales ban on motorola products by paying 25 million euros to see it happen. nevertheless muller thinks that motorola isnt in deep waters just yet:  &quot;motorola doesn't have to look far for a workaround: stock android (the version of android that google makes available for download) comes with a glow effect instead of the overscroll bounce.&quot;  google and motorola mobility are expected to appeal the decision at the munich higher regional court to try to revoke apple's patent at the european patent office, arguing that it should never have been granted to begin with.</text>

    <text>a report on apple insider today says that according to japanese website macotakara, apples new lightning dock connector will be able to host usb devices, which means that the manufacturers of third-party accessories will be able to market totally different products than were previously possible with the old 30-pin dock connector. appleinsider says that up until now, the ipad was the only ios device that was able to host usb devices, via a camera connection kit. the kit, which was only compatible with the ipad and not the iphone or ipod touch, enabled the user to connect cameras, wired keyboards and other similar usb devices to their ipad. now, if this report is proved to be correct, the lightning connector has built-in usb support, so you may well be able to connect usb accessories to it such as cameras and keyboards, via third-party accessories. apparently apple has said that lighting ports will be supported by third-party accessory makers such as bose, jbl and b&amp;w.</text>

    <text>semiconductor analyst linley gwennap has posted an interesting overview (via cnet) of the series of events that led to apple's a6 system-on-a-chip, the company's first entirely custom arm chip design. the report notes that apple has likely spent in excess of $500 million on the project when including the purchase prices of chip firms p.a. semi and intrinsity. at this point, apple has spent about $400 million to buy pa semi and intrinsity, tens of millions for a license to design its own arm cpus, and probably north of $100 million to support its cpu design efforts over the past four years. it appears that the end result will be that apple ships a cortex-a15-class cpu about three months before arch-enemy samsung does. these three months happen to come during the big holiday buying season, during which the iphone 5 could generate $25 billion in revenue. so that half billion dollars could be money well spent.</text>

    <text>appleinsider writes today that leading piper jaffray analyst gene munster has said that the iphone 5 is a rolex in comparison to its competitors, which he says are more like a timex. munster says that apple is set to sell between 6 million to 10 million iphone 5s in the september quarter, which ends at the end of september. munster has managed to have hands-on time with the iphone 5, and says that it has an improved feel and build in comparison to previous iphones. appleinsider reports that piper jaffray and investing analytics also kept tabs on how the iphone 5 went down online, and found that twitter posts about the new phone saw a 460% year over year increase compared to iphone 4s launch day, with blog posts about the iphone 5 also up 100% year over year. munster said that 73% of tweets about the iphone 5 were positive, in comparison with 15% for the iphone 4s launch.</text>

    <text>i dont know why people look at the sales to say something is good. every people has his/her own choice. if youre talking about iphone 5 i wouldnt even purchase an iphone 5 even when its price is 10000 rupees. i would go for nokia or an android phone. nokia phones bodies are solid than the others. their cameras are unbeatable by other phones. now dont say that iphone this iphone that!. n8 was used for a south african magazine photoshoot i dont think any of the iphone will be used for that kind of stuff in the next 100 years. i used to drop my n8 and there wasnt even a scratch on its screen (dont do that with iphone because not only screen but its body will also get messed up). theres nothing new in iphones its a mixture of different products in short a copy bundle. thats my reason not to even look at an iphone. now please dont get all emotional and start an arguement because i just told my opinion im not starting an arguement.</text>

    <text>hey guys just think it of 1. how will you use your old high priced accesories using i5 . buy a adapter ,switch it to your accesory and then your new iphone 5 . 2. what about gaming guys all the developer must redesign 3. in lodon there where 10mil nfc payment users before incorporating nfc in mobiles . now it comes handy in other phones . see in wiki about how nfc is used in many countries. 4. except html 5 and its webkit where is open source. including devs are forced into its eco system. 5. where is the wifi direct which is being equipted in hdtv and pc.they force us to buy their tv apple and its services . they call this as airplay. 6.ever video taken by your handycam must be converted. 7. last 1: if they had not created a closed ecosystem according to their will . there would be no jailbreak. think about devs.</text>

    <text>iphone 4 &amp; 4s were giving 14 hrs talk time in 2g. but this one is 8 hours ??? it does not matter as i am going to buy it for 3g but there are countries who are still 2g. thanks to singtel they say i can re-contract without any top up and also i have a 100$ voucher for next upgrade. so i am buying this because it is free. i can get the 32gb and pay nothing though the 12 gb data will be downgraded on recontract to 4gb. still cheaper if one consider 5$ per gb for additional data. design is not a ground breaking design but will buy for stable application on ios.</text>

    <text>truly lacking innovation. it is a nightmare where one thinks it has the so called &quot;brand image&quot;, it can slow down innovation to save costs but yield profits as much as possible. boo apple boo...steve jobs would've not done this.  apple executives are bunch of insecure people that they have to belittle bluntly their competitors in their keynote speech. their speeches sounded propaganduous and i think they are republicans.  dont get me wrong, i've been using apple products for years, ipod touch, ipad 3, iphone 4 and is happy so far (product-wise). but the way apple do business, is completely low and disgraceful...</text>

    <text>i am a samsung user, and i admit that i want to switch to iphone5. yes iphone5 is beautiful and classy. yes ios is stable, fluid, and has tons of high quality apps.  but... 1. only 4&quot; display? come on apple. my galaxy note easily beats you. is 4.3&quot; or 4.5&quot; a problem 4 you? 2. still no bluetooth file transfer. *sigh 3. file manager is still problematic. itunes only. 4. limited customisation. even blackberry can change its theme. even windows8 can change it's tiles size and color. 5. nano sim card? oh god why?! means that my sim card will not be compatible to other phones except iphone5  i'm still waiting for the real review of iphone5. meanwhile i keep my eyes on galaxy note2</text>

    <text>well, apple still using this similar design with iphone 4, because simply it is the best design for smartphone for now. every other brand try to make their design similar with it, i think it's stupid if apple leave this design. samsung use their s3 new design and called it innovation, i think we all know s2 base design is better than s3. samsung change their design simply cause they have no choice to copy paste apple design anymore. fyi i love iphone but using sony android too. i must be honest i didn't like samsung for what they do. learn from sony who try to use their own design than copy others.</text>

    <text>following today's news that the iphone 5 has set a record with over two million pre-orders during the first 24 hours of availability last friday, apple's stock price is rising once more. apple's share price broke through the $700 mark for the first time today in after-hours trading, continuing the company's meteoric rise as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.  the stock price has been on a tear -- albeit with a bit of a lull in the middle of the year -- since apple reported blowout earnings for the first fiscal quarter of 2012, rising more than $270/share, or over 65%, in nine months.   at the end of february, apple broke through the important psychological barrier of $500 billion in market capitalization, then through $600 billion in april. apple is now worth more than $650 billion, which is $225 billion -- or approximately one google -- more than second-place exxonmobil.</text>

    <text>very well said, and this is even with apple not having to be the very fastest, since its ios is already optimised for best performance.  no wonder even nokia decided to tightly integrate the os to its hardware according to ios philosophy. now the results are showing and there is a lot of interest in lumia from android users.  iphone 5 and lumia 920 are possibly the two best phones on the market right now. xperia t is also very impressive, only let down by having android. thankfully, even sony have changed their mind and said they are open to adopting wp8.</text>

    <text>it's sad that a 4&quot; iphone that only has daulcores clocked at 1.02ghz can outperform any high end android quadcore smartphone. now that my friends is embarrassing. some may say that the samsung gs3 with jellybean pulls even a better benchmark score, but really think about this. a iphone that is not even clocked at 1.5ghz with daulcores and 1gb ram can still go toe to toe with a quadcore phone. thats speak volumes. a++++ for apple. the only quadcore that is in a iphone is its gpu which make sense for high end games. apple is smart. it makes technonlgy that is beneficial.  why waste time, space and effort to make a quadcore cpu when 90% of apps in the playstore and app store don't even use it to full capacity. it just goes to show android is just full of gimmicks!</text>

    <text>i know many things about technology and i love iphone 5 because the ios is much better than android because android is full of bugs.the performance of ios is much higher than android.apple a6 is designed only by apple and because of that it would be amazing with a very good performance and a great graphic.the camera of iphone 5 is better than samsung galaxy s3.the ppi is more than galaxy s3 and the network is better too.just the fault of that is it doesn't have radio and nfc.4 inch is enouph because the phone must be portable a iif you want a big screen you can buy a tablet and siri is amazing and very much better than s voice.</text>

    <text>i think the big issue of ip5 is in the design. apple kept 58.6 mm wide (stretched screen!) while other smartphones had &gt; 60 mm width for about 4 inches screen. i think it is not a suitable size for playing multimedia, left a big blank screen in scale zoom mode for instance.</text>

    <text>apple is simply going at its pace, just like macbook and imac, very minor external changes, where the changes are more internal and more for affecting performance and user experience. the iphone 4s was such a smooth and fluid phone, imagine what double the speed will do.  fact is, most of the bashing here has been without even seeing the new iphone in the flesh. reports from all the hands-on reviews indicate very impressive build.  also the iphone new touch sensor and screen in one layer apparently makes the pixels look like they are on the glass as opposed to below it.  this is going to be a truly epic smartphone, the king of smartphones.</text>

    <text>ios vs android os      techradar quotes 'i own ios and android devices and have played with windows mobile extensively. they are all nice to use. android is dramatically more powerful than the other two operating systems and, for business users and social networkers and developers android has far more industry standard apps available, many for free. and it syncs instantly and easily with both windows and mac networks without any trouble at all.' 'android 4.1 is faster, smoother and much better looking, and it cracks the distinction between phone and tablet devices in a way it hasn't before.'</text>

    <text>so the a6 chip will be double the speed of the 4s and its a bigger screen. still extremly dissapointed with this piece of junk. so what if its faster iphones are usually buttery smooth anyway theres no real way to notice the speed difference and the screen size is a little bit better cuz my 4s felt like a toy after a while but seriously apple? no widgets or new ui changes or anything?? youve had about 10 years now of the same thing and its getting old. this isnt even worth it...</text>

    <text>so what? it's longer and a bit thinner. what else? it still looks like a rectangle with curved edges. if they made a car like that, you'd think it looks stupid. it's nice and expensive, but overall, there's nothing new. this is the end of apple. the ipad is dead. this will kill the iphone. the ipod is dying as everybody just uses their phone. macs will die out as soon as hipsters get old. who knows, maybe that will encourage apple to make something better. probably not though.</text>

    <text>every hands-on preview so far says that just holding the iphone 5 leaves you with an incredible impression of quality. now millions upon millions of people are about to experience that build quality. plastic phones are going to just feel cheap.  at least sony and nokia use higher grade materials. even htc is using better grade material than samsung.</text>

    <text>i bought the galaxy s3 over the 4s because it has a larger screen. but sometimes it lags a bit when playing gta3 and games with good graphics such as temple run. but when i saw the iphone 5 im definetly going to buy it and sell my s3. its not that i dont like my s3 but i like gaming and i dont think the s3 has the potential for that. also app store has much more better apps and games than android. i still like samsung but im shifting to iphone 5 hping that samsung makes a better phone by the way im not an android fan nor an apple fan</text>

    <text>this will be my first iphone ive owned personally, after having dozens of android and windows phones, i want a phone that is going to last. there are people i know still using their iphone 3g today, cant say that about htc, samsung or nokia.  iphones are supported longer, simple as that, they will always be the best until android and windows stop making drastic changes every year like a child who doesn't know what toy to play with.  apple don't need to redesign the iphone every year because it already rocks an amazing interface and hardware. they just need to fine tune it until perfection.  -owner of sony ericcson c905, htc incredible s, samsung galaxy s 1, s2, htc one x, lumia 800, lumia 900, nokia n9, blackberry bold 9780 and soon to be iphone 5. dont be calling me a hater.</text>

    <text>while the iphone 5 may still sell well due to the hype and apples marketing wizardry, it is a technological disaster for 3 simple reasons 1) samsung overtook apple with the galaxy s iii launched in may, 4 months before iphone 5 so they already have a lead in the market. 2) with iphone 5 everyone was expecting apple to charge way ahead of the samsung flagship device or at least match it spec to spec. even after coming 4 months late it still doesnt do that. 3) it would be very surprising if samsung is not already working on the next galaxy model which is sure to have even more impressive specs and additional features. 5) considering that apple releases products once a year, we can assume that the new device wont be there for at least another year. its like a relay race where every model hands the baton to the next one. with galaxy s iii samsung overtook apple. we were thinking the iphone 5 would make it a level playing field. but the gap only seems to be increasing.</text>

    <text>&quot;iphone 5 : 1)slimmer (7,6 vs 8,6) 2)lighter (112g vs 134 g) 3) better design(aluminium glass like a jewelry vs cheap plastic like a bar of soap 4)premium feel( not some cheap product) 5)more comfortable in hand (one hand vs two hands) 6) graphics (326ppi vs 306 ppi )(crisper text apps and images) 7) security(anytime restore vs permanant software damage 4get samsung kies not 100% safe as iphone because android is open service can get viruses ) 8)better quality of apps (lifestyle entertainment social, gaming, ca) 9)better quantity of apps(+700000) 10) store (itunes vs who again ??) 11)better game center vs gamehub (multiplayer between games available you can't even play doodle jump or flick kick between two samsung devices nobody even uses gamehub 12)better siri (siri vs svoice (failed copy of siri !!!) 13)features : cydia vs android seriously samsung :d??! 14)icloud vs scloud (easy yo know who is the winner at least you can put apps in cloud and share and connect between tablet (ipad ) and smartphone iphone . 15) imessage feature (who would resist a bbm on iphone ?! 16) passbook vs nfc i call it a draw 17) ios6 ( newer os compared to last year's ics) 18)the shared photostream feature avoiding that eh ? 19) no viruses (android ics is a linux based server it can very likely get viruses while surfing the net 20) facetime (#1 mobile video service on any os) vs ??!! 21) exclusivity of the apps (besides quality and quantity) google takes way longer to have apps the appstore already has like instagram i.e.) 22) even the same apps don't have the same features (where is arcade mode on flick kick and multiplayer on doodle jump where is manager mode in fifa 12??!) 23) any pants vs cargo pants i'll stick with any pants . 24) customer service (all your questions are answered in 2 minutes online you don't need to send it to the company to fix it. 25) customer satisfaction : iphone is #1 for four years straight (jd) 26) simplicity of os vs unnecessary features (tilt to zoom and picture in picture who cares about the spiral design in photos app and the more homescreens the hard it is to access to you're app 26) iphone maps (improved 3d flyover crrisper view) vs same old google maps s3 is better in what i don't get it same amount of rams same responsiveness nfc ok but even that is omitted by passbook 26-0 final score you just got owned samsung :o don't even try getting close to apple's iphone 5 . iphone 5 will be phone of the year . have you ever heard about sold out in one hour . you made a fool of yourself with this ad. iphone 5 is the next big thing .&quot; thumbs up for iphone 5! please share !! :p</text>

    <text>what a surprise, apple block samsung (biggest rivals) just weeks before they release their new overrated and overpriced ipad and iphone. what a surprise that they release only a few units (much less than demand) so that we get the impression they are sold out everywhere. what a surprise that the usa control the global media and have used this to their advantage to publise their own products - apple. other phones never get such publicity when they are released and believe me, they are several other better handsets. people open your eyes, don't believe the hype and save your money. this phone has serious restrictions - no sd card, no blue tooth, no flash, itunes only  on 3 pcs and much more. do research before buying. ignore the american controlled media for an american product.</text>

    <text>hye i have no doubt the performance of the iphone5 will be great but as every expert suggests it will be merely bringing the phone on par with current flagships. but its really not the issue.. i mean surely apple knew the specs of the final retail version of the iphone5 before the launch of the 12th.. yet they let you think it was going to be sporting the a15 cpu, also announced almost a week later there would be no  voice calls/ simultaneous lte data.. 'worlds thinnest phone' again false.. why wait nearly a full week after its launch and however many pre sale orders down to announce these short comings???? and why is there no voice calls/ simultaneous lte data? other phones do it.. wouldnt have made a difference to the size of the phone... someone say profit margin??? again apple slaps fans in the face, yet they stand fast... mind boggling</text>

    <text>i don't know why guys from apple won't reveal more details about the cpu? number of cores? megahertz? i'll tell you this: it's a dual core &quot;customized&quot; version of armv7 architecture, and it's a crappy one compared to galaxy s3 or htc one x because they all support quad-core chips, they feature 720p displays. so it's another piece of crap for apple &quot;fanbois&quot;, an outdated device just for blind lovers of their brand.</text>

    <text>apple is just another bully in the neighbourhood.its fighting dirty with samsung because it can't win a fair corporate fight with technology against samsung.dear apple users, use your brain and compare i phone 5 with galaxy note 2.in any way the mighty apple cant beat the awesomeness of the note.apple user can deny this truth, but in their heart they know its the fact that apple is becoming histor y.this company isn't even selling laptops like they used .because of the ultrabook provided by hp.so, what apple will do now??? file a lawsuit against hp??? grow up apple, either provide good technology our just get out of the horizon.let other companies to serve us with up to date products.remember, we're not yourslaves any more.you fooled us, treated us with disrespect, but not anymore.you're time is up pal....</text>

    <text>samsung is a perfect example of a company that i must say, has gone from grass to grace! :-) and i'm very, very glad about that.  they now have a huge, full box of softwares and patent features to their credit: the stylus for s pen, pop-up-play, smart stay, smart alert, s beam, direct call, best photo, tilt to zoom, palm touch to mute/pause, palm swipe capture, turn over to mute, shake to update, to mention but a few; whereas apple has barely siri!  i grabbed my own box of the galaxy s iii on 5th september and i can swear to the fact that i haven't regretted buying it for one split second! :-p  let's forget about the plastic body of course - it's rather disgraceful to apple(i'm afraid) that a piece of cheap plastic could offer more fun and features to its users than a so-called extraordinary piece of aluminum or glass or whatever.</text>

    <text>apple what has got into you.. so this is the iphone 5 what we have been waiting for.. i mean what's the difference in the looks to the iphone 4/4s.. oh u gave it a smaller charging point and aux on the bottem of the fone. what's the point.. same style as previous and re arranging the charging and aux to the opposite.. a wider screen and abit thinner.. 8mp cam same as 4s.. apple you should of thought of a totally new look for this handset.. not surprised at all as other makes seem to be doing better and apple here taking the mick.. i have the 4s and honestly well bored of it but still jus gona keep it as it does most of the things i want it to.. apart from bluetooth sending/receiving.. i bet the iphone 5 still can't send or receive on bluetooth.. oh wow i can just connect my bluetooth ear piece and thts about it.. so apple u r actually taking the mick.. so wot u gona do bring out the 5s like u did wid the 4s later later on somewhere down the line.. and u prob will jus giv it the same look and add 8.1 mp to camera lol.. honestly i'm not really into apple as i would want to be.. the 5 has just put me of so much.. also got ipad 3 as a gift and u kno what.. they r also sh*tttt.. good look in how much money u make wid the 5.. the name of apple is big in this world but the products of apple are getting worse.. just make something like when u see it and also the features u actally say yes apple has woken up after all these years..</text>

    <text>hey guys , seeing flamewars about samsung and apple makes me laugh.... anyways,apple has created some good phones (i was a fanboy a while back).but when i realized that iphones were a bit too overpriced i was turned off.but then again,it depends on where you're comfortable disappointed with the phone. besides why do we have to jailbreak the phone every time apple decides not to include the feature why don't they just include all the main functions required into the phone like all other companies do. i feel for the 4s apple started to lose its way. a user needs some changes in the phone from the interface to the way the apps look to the phone shape etc etc which apple has not done. the iphone has become extremely boring...... thank god for other competitors that are feeding that market and providing the consumers with what they want like samsung the differences between the 4s and the 5. firstly, it's the 4-inch screen, 0.5 inches bigger than te 4s. then it's the quad-core 1.2 ghz processor, witch is way better compared to the dual core 1 ghzn on it's proecessor. it has 4g and the camera must be really good at 8 mpx.simultaneous hd video and image recording, touch focus, geo-tagging, face detection, panorama, hdr secondary- yes, 1.2 mp, 720p@30fps, maybe it's not a huge difference but neither is the one between samsung gs2 and gs3. my personal opinion is that -and i'm not an apple fan- the iphone 5 can be one of the best 4 phones on the market, competing with the big 3 available today- samsung gs3, htc one x and lg optimus 4x but im still an android (htc) fan... ;&gt;by sam david</text>

    <text>another standard response of an iphone 5 fan...this time he resorts to &quot;treats and insults&quot; be careful sir, you might get banned haha we are just posting opinions and questions here...i have one for you, a question no iphone 5 fans has been able to answer yet...  answer this if tim cook's apple is so advanced...how come the iphone 5 has: no nfc no radio (non data) no real multi-tasking (2 or 3 major apps running at the same time) no sd card slot no concurrent voice and data lte support no water, dust, and scratch free exterior no customizations no hd screen no 3d screen no wireless charging  pls. don't change the topic...  iphone 4s is the best from steve jobs apple iphone 5 = lackluster</text>

    <text>i`ve had all the previous 5 iphones and for the 1st time i can`t see myself getting this one. nice upgrade if you have a 3s but if you have a 4 or 4s theres nothing thats really innovative that makes you go wow. getting a bit bored of the apple ui if i`m honest. i know theres only so much you can do with a phone but the iphone 5 is not far different from the original 2g and thats about 5 years old now. interested to see what the nokia 920 is like.</text>

    <text>this could only qualify as iphone 4ss.  why not have lte bands per region. if you live in europe you want all 800,1800,2600 bands not one european band (1800) and other irrelevant bands. all the bands will have commercial rollout with next 6months. people are buying premium phones for 2 years and not get stuck on 3g.  but probably apple will pull another misleading advert on customers to get them to buy it as full 4g.  the latest versions of iphone and ipads clearly lack innovations.  apple should focus on innovation and technology rather trying to eliminate competition and establish monopoly  in us courts with laugable patents.</text>

    <text>what is &quot;groundbreaking&quot; innovation? apple has already done it with the design of it's iphones. we don't want any groundbreaking re-design of the iphone. a smartphone should be a pleasure to use and should have all the features to make it &quot;one and only&quot; device to hold on to and sorted. so, only the iphone satisfies our need more than any other phone.  apple clarifies that the processor is a much more powerful dual-core arm cortex a-15 based one, which blows everything else including the &quot;quad-core snapdragon s4 krait&quot;. it's a customized design by apple for it's ios. it's highly optimized to work wonderfully with the hardware. the screen is made so much thinner with inline design, which makes the screen so fabulous to look and work on. the outer casing is anodized aluminium and glass, and are designed to make it lighter and sturdier. the lte chip is the ultra compact as apple has redesigned it to work with a single chip. the battery capacity is not that important as a phone optimized to work with it's components (the iphone battery gives lte and 3g navigation at 8 hrs) is far better than a powerful non-optimized one. in my opinion, these are innovation enough for a company which gives finest smartphones in the planet year after year. so much feature in so thin a smartphone is innovative enough.</text>

    <text>i have a galaxy s3. while its the best phone i have ever used, i still find myself drawn towards the iphone 5 and the aesthetic charisma that glows around it.  i will probably give negative reviews about it in my community just to make people feel disillusioned with apple n start selling it off and i may buy a pre-owned phone since price of iphone 5 in pakistan is going to be around 130k pkr.. which is more than monthly income of 90% of pakistanis, including me :d</text>

    <text>cmon dude, ppl hate iphone because its spec, but imho as an android n ios user, no matter how &quot;fast&quot; you chip, how many &quot;cores&quot; your chip, how massive pixel on your camera, how &quot;big&quot; and &quot;wide&quot; your phone screen, how beautiful your screen, etc; iphone with ios is better, 1. maybe some android phone like mine (sgs2) has better chip than my iphone4 but i feel its a little slow in my opinion; 2. my sgs2 has 8mpix cam n my iphone 4 has 5mpix cam, but its true, iphone cam better than sgs2; 3. my sgs2 has 4,3inch n iphone4 has 3,5inch screen, first its hard to type on my sgs2 bcause the screen is to wide, but on my iphone is nice n easy to type (thats why iphone5 make its screen just longer not wider), but maybe a little wider not a problem, but just a little, 4. sgs2 claiming super amoled display is super beautiful screen with super beautiful colour, but i think, its beautiful of course, its colourfull of course but not natural, its like to much contrast, to much colour, not beautifull (for me), and for the last why you ppl who hates iphone see and comment (with full of jealous and regret maybe) on this apple iphone 5 pages if ure not interested at iphone at all? and make this &quot;super ugly tall phone&quot; (haters opinion) be #1 hits on gsm arena (not just #1 hits, but more than two times than beautifull galaxy s3) sorry for my bd english and my borring opinion</text>

    <text>last year apple was first place ,now it is in second and next year it will be third because its heart is so small and gives priority for money not for people.it is assembeled in china,apple just put os to make price too high.now  nobody wants to pay money just for brand name but cheks specification.in china its been pushed 5th place from second.</text>

    <text>actually, in the us they are kind of forcing you to buy their products, more specifically the iphone, by kicking the competition out of the market. apple is a great brand, but it's trying to restrict the consumer's choice in the &quot;all-liberal&quot; america.</text>

    <text>i have been reading posts through many pages, but all i can read are all people who are really unhappy with the sucess of iphone. believe me guys, nobody (at present) can stop iphone success and you are just wasting your time attacking apple or iphone. don't you be happy using your favorite brand like samsung, sony, htc, nokia, bb, etc? why you are so angry (like angry bird) with the success of iphone? those of you who are not using iphone or does not want apple products, apple company does not force you to buy their products. i am a samsung fan but i accept that iphone success is incomparable and i don't know apple's magic why millions and millions of people are buying their products especially iphones. just be guys happy what brand you are supporting. again, nobody (at this point in time) can stop apple's success with all their products.</text>

    <text>thank god apple did not mess up  with the iphone 5. in my opinion there are ios fans, wp8 fans and android fans and that's a good thing cause if you don't like the one you can choose the other. no point arguing about which phone is the best and which worst. one buys what one wants. i am a longtime iphone user but i also use my android phone too. both phones have shortcomings but i can live with both</text>

    <text>wow i see lots of hates and lovers well i'm not both.but this time ill defend other brands.first everyone is crying and defending themself by sayng that iphone is quality product,unibody metal and stuff.well gues what that makes it worst ...why drop it once screen gone...cause its heavy.i had iphone 4s and that happened 20cm off the ground(soft)second you need both front and back covers cause its scratching like omg..my htc one x the plastic toy you're saying well that plastic is hell of a quality if someone manages to brake that phone than man youve got skills.cheap plastic but holds better i do have from the begining of sale and still no mark without covers nothin that kind.now iphone is a phone for an old man definetly cause its so dam boring guys how can not admit the actual truth same old icons on screen and white blue menu oh cmon.yes its easy to use but its good fo people who wants this.i as i believe lots of people likes better graphic visualisation more than couple icons on the screen.lets continue to camera well i dont know what they put in 5 model but hox and ss3 cameras are way more better both in quality speed and ect.speed everyone is talking about speed.iphone is so freakin fast well yes and the reason is ios.well if you try to run ios on any newest android phone it will rocket fly cause its simple the is no basic animations no hd tags nothing thats why its fast and everyone knows it.next apple is a name not quality.apple was firs to launch touch screen phones and lots of people got them those days and got used to it now we all know how difficult it is to jump on the other manufactor ehh.so guys stop saying iphone quality its best and shit like that and admit that it was the best like 2-3 years ago and boom they exausted now.just like nokia did couple of years ago.i'm am most happy with my plastic toy now cause i have light huge screaned computer in my palm htc one x yeas it has software problems but its easy fixable plastic is very durable ,its protected against scrathes bumps and ect.and its just fun as ss3 or others.but apple wants to be a refuge like we have our own mac ,ios and thats where the problem is.well now punish me for the truth ,but apple guys realy wake up and look you pay twice the price than android phone every second person in world has iphone and that sucks and the quality is useless cause if you drop it good it will be fu****ed.so now tell me atleast one reason to have iphone.?...thank you</text>

    <text>cut and paste from zdnet  article titled 'iphone 5 has enterprise potential, but disappointing overall'  summary: apple's latest gadget offers features suitable for work, making it a worthy contender in the enterprise space, but isn't revolutionary enough and adds inconvenience to consumers.  new features in apple's iphone 5 have strong potential for enterprise usage but, overall, the device is a disappointment  disappointing for consumers for consumers, though, the iphone 5 will not be evolutionary like the iphone 3 and iphone 4 was in terms of form factor, user experience and software, nath said, adding that the latest release is not very different in terms of the way it looks and behaves.  the new smartphone also had been &quot;highly hyped&quot; with many carrying high expectations, especially since they had expected the iphone 5 to be unveiled last year but got iphone 4s instead, he noted.  iphone 5's new features merely brought apple on par with android devices, particularly the samsung s3, the market leader in terms of smartphone, nath remarked.  jan dawson, chief telecom analyst at ovum, added that with many android and windows phone devices now significantly larger than the iphone 4s, and gaining popularity, the pressure was on apple to release a larger device but it did not.</text>

    <text>damn all this hate from android users.. that's how you know apple is the most adavnced efficient os yesterday, today and tomorrow and the figures don't lie.. sit down and stay pressed. no one wants to use your 2nd rated os for shit. developers know ios is the main stage to showcase their apps. who the hell use nfc, no one but 0.1 percent of the android population. apple still manages to make a glass &amp; aluminum beautiful slim, and litephone without using cheap plastic. everything on android just screams 2nd rated. gazllion over hyped features that hardly works. apple is not going to invest in overhyped comic features that will lead to problems. that is why it did not jump on the lte bandwagon at 1st. who in the hell gonna jump on something that is not even well establish. lte is still growing; nfc, wireless charging are just a few. iphone hands down has the best flawless os and polished apps. i see why apple hasn't added anything particular new, it's because their phones and os has been always been solid especially since the iphone 4. the iphone is the only phone to have the best camera in the mobile world today. iphone 5 will be no exception. android has to come out with updates every 3-6 months. jellybean, yes is a great addition but it's still not solid. keep on reaching! iphone 5 is a great addition to the apple family. i love the fact that when you get an iphone you have the latest and greatest phone for that whole year, then you have android that constantly comes out with new better phones for their standards every month. now u don't have the latest and greatest phone as you may think and may at times feel cheated with your 1 month old stall phone. so to end this, samsung loses #1 spot after being the #1 smartphone for 1 month, while apple reclaims it's throne for another full year. enough said!</text>

    <text>what most people do not realise about iphone 5's improvements to the touch screen. the sensor and glass are now one layer instead of two separate layers.    from the article:  &quot;the integration of the touch sensors into the display itself provides a noticeable reduction in thickness. i wrotewhen i first saw the iphone 4 in 2010 apples first retina display and the first time the company laminated the display to the glass surface, eliminating the thin layer of air between those components  that it looked like pixelsonglass rather than pixelsunderglass. now, after seeing the new iphone 5 display, my iphone 4s display seems as thick as a coke bottle.&quot;</text>

    <text>it's not about the quantity of additional new function throw into the new phone, its about the quality of particle (traditional) function and innovation of add-on(s).  the camera obviously upgraded, cpu does, screen size is just fit, calling quality is improved by its new (bought) noisy cancellation technology, digital connector (lightning) once again will unify the accessory market in the next decade. just put in mind, mobile phones are limited in size, their battery life is also limited, you wont be able to do that much of function on such handy device, if thats what you demand for, go for a tablet, the new ipad.</text>

    <text>the basic answer to everyone who says android is just a plastic copy of ios. android came much before ios,and as well the features,specially the drop down notification bar,which released in android 1.0 prototype,which was not released.it came in the stable release of android 1.5 cupcake.oh by the way,ios 5 is just android! and people who say samsung sucks,apple used samsung parts on the previous models of the iphone! so think before you speak!!</text>

    <text>in early benchmarks performed by tech sites such as anandtech and pcmag, the s4 pro, despite being clocked at the same 1.5ghz, smokes every competitor  except the ipad 3&amp;#8242;s a5x. in graphics benchmarks, the new adreno 320 gpu is twice as fast as its predecessor, the adreno 225 (found in the s4 plus). the adreno 320 still loses out to the a5xs quad-core powervr sgx 543mp4 in most benchmarks, but it beats tegra 3 and exynos 4 (mali 400) comfortably.  the dual-core s4 was already giving the quad-core tegra 3 and samsung exynos 4 chips a run for their money  and now, with four cores and the adreno 320 gpu, nvidia and samsung have been left in the dust. for the most part, this is entirely down to the fact that qualcomms snapdragon s4 uses the cortex-a15-esque krait core, which is miles ahead of the cortex-a9 core used by every other arm smartphone soc on the market.  so, when apple a5x-processor matches the quad-core snapdragon s4, now the a6 with arm cortex a15 architecture will leave everything else in the dust.</text>

    <text>processor: why would you care the number of cores, architecture, etc if it just works with no lag? i hope you don't buy a phone just to run benchmarks.  ram: the way ios implements multitasking by suspending apps, not as much ram is required. android offers multitasking with the apps actually running, so more ram. so why it all depends on the os. (ie, why microsoft windows requires much higher spec than linux? they're just different)  size: if you just want it big, why do you think galaxy note is too big? i do like being able to do things single-handedly. if size is everything, don't use a phone, use a galaxy tab.  screen: i hope you're not buying a phone just to stare at the screen for pixels. they're all good.  design: everybody knows it's really subjective here . no phone is really ugly, just to you, perhaps.  apps: this one apple does win. even the same apps are better designed for ios than android.  openess: this one android wins. why jail the phone? if i want to save files to my device, just let me do so. i love android this way.  again, the point is, don't defend your phone with your life before trying the others. every phone has goods and bads. i don't believe iphone or sg3 is the best on the planet. if you think otherwise, you're jailed by yourself and need to be jail broken.  so, be open and be nice.</text>

    <text>i used to be a symbian fan (since n95). then the iphone came out. nokia fanboys at the time were reluctant to give the iphone a try, but kept saying that it sucked. but the moment i tried one, i couldn't believe how i've lived in denial.  then i became an apple fanboy. at the time with my iphone 4, galaxy s2 came about. i gave it a try and, well, there were goods and bads. the apps on android just don't look as good as on the iphone. seems like developers develop the ios version ahead of android. but the good, i can use my s2 the way i like it, especially with saving files and using it as a usb mass storage device. different browsers that actually behave like different browsers. what i don't like is how background in is implemented here. i have to keep watching out what's eating my battery. and rouge apps could be running without me knowing. iphone background in is not real but i actually like it because apps can be truly suspended.  now iphone 5 comes along. i think i'll give it a try. my point is, for apple fanboys, iphone 5 does lack a bit of customizability, android gives you much more freedom. but if you like stock everything then what can we do. for android fanboys, if you haven't tried an iphone, you really should, you'll be surprised. if you have, you'll understand when i said that both have some shortcomings.  be open, and be nice.</text>

    <text>hey guys , seeing flamewars about samsung and apple makes me laugh.... anyways,apple has created some good phones (i was a fanboy a while back).but when i realized that iphones were a bit too overpriced i was turned off.but then again,it depends on where you're comfortable disappointed with the phone. besides why do we have to jailbreak the phone every time apple decides not to include the feature why don't they just include all the main functions required into the phone like all other companies do. i feel for the 4s apple started to lose its way. a user needs some changes in the phone from the interface to the way the apps look to the phone shape etc etc which apple has not done. the iphone has become extremely boring...... thank god for other competitors that are feeding that market and providing the consumers with what they want like samsung the differences between the 4s and the 5. firstly, it's the 4-inch screen, 0.5 inches bigger than te 4s. then it's the quad-core 1.2 ghz processor, witch is way better compared to the dual core 1 ghzn on it's proecessor. it has 4g and the camera must be really good at 8 mpx.simultaneous hd video and image recording, touch focus, geo-tagging, face detection, panorama, hdr secondary- yes, 1.2 mp, 720p@30fps, maybe it's not a huge difference but neither is the one between samsung gs2 and gs3. my personal opinion is that -and i'm not an apple fan- the iphone 5 can be one of the best 4 phones on the market, competing with the big 3 available today- samsung gs3, htc one x and lg optimus 4x but im still an android (htc) fan...</text>

    <text>iphone presentations used to be exciting, and always had the wow factor...back when steve jobs was still alive...but most of the apple fans here (aside from blind duds like, mr steele) are afraid to admit that apple failed us fans...htey failed in the design and made it ugly by stretching the screen...did not do any real innovation...aside from copy panorama and lte from htc and samsung, etc...and they did not live up to the promise that iphone 5 will be the best smartphone of 2012...my iphone 4s is a much more beautiful device because its screen is balanced...but i am not afraid to admit that apple under tim cooks leadership is going downhill with the iphone 5</text>

    <text>well i grounded my iphone 4 (gave to wife ) and ipad 2 (gave to daughter) and bought tab 7.7. which served both purpose. i was waiting for the iphone 5 so that i could go back to more stabler os with significant hardware upgrade. but this release of iphone 5 was like another incremental similar to 4s only thing good here is the slight bigger screen still smaller then the enter level of 4.3 which has become a norm. the processor is powerful but i think iphone 4s processor was more then good for this ios. atleast they should have changed the shape and not look like hammered 4s to make it longer. very boring design. the nokia 920 release looks more exciting then this. now i will hold for few months to decide between window or ios. need to move away from andriod as it is fragmented took ages to get ics and no chance of getting jelly bin.</text>

    <text>what crapple is doing, they are releasing their phone late, in the 1q and 2q of the year other companies are releasing their flagship devices while crapple is silently studying those features, but this have failed big this time. maybe because they become to careful in copying because of the patent law that they started.  bottom line: they are the copycats they are innovating from others innovation (and after a while they will act like they are the first)  now crapple because of that pathetic move suing other companies from &quot;copying the one that you copied&quot; we will see who will suffer the most :d</text>

    <text>for apple ,long term needs to be adopted for getting more results..there is no big difference between iphone 4s and iphone 5 so,i prefer to buy 4s because is much cheaper than new version.believe me or not  galaxy s3 is much better rather than iphone 5.today is a technology era, accordingly people seek for smart phone not carry high prestige and i hold firmly to the belief that iphone 5 is not as smart as others are.but still is a good phone .</text>

    <text>all of this for their new idumb 5 and still no radio???  lol  no nfc either (claiming passbook will do this) lol  must be the aluminum case (which they had issues with before) blocking all sorts of radio-type signals, etc...!  i have a samsung galaxy s24g and with a few mods or software i can have the same if not better (except for the battery-life): i can even add the s3 stuff with not too much trouble with software, etc...!  i don't even have to use itunes, etc...  lol  i wonder when the next samsung vs idumb court case will be, or what about??  lol  what a joke idumb!!!! samsung should just stop making chips for you!  nice try for a nice looking phone though!!!!  perhaps its time nokia should also get a 4g phone, provided they do not use win8, they have most everything included in their phones now and have done for a long time. go symbian!!!!  lol: you would never think i am still a heartfelt nokia fan, now would you?    lol  cheers!!!!</text>

    <text>overall iphone5 is a bit dissapointed as compare the current market mobile devices that available. however, we must also appreciate apple team to create this new iphone 5 with detail cincern to the user. such like the handy issue so the iphone to be taller rather than maintain 4:3 ratio which would cause problem for certain stage of ppl like ladies.tmprovement from 3.5&quot; to 4&quot; screen size is another breakthrough with 7.6mm thickness. the overall phone design material is really high quality as compare most of the phone out side which still majority uses plastic case which looks less in durability. new in cell touch screen make the phone thinner with aluminium metal body also make the phone lighther for convenient carry for every user. however, son't all of us notice that iphone still maintain better graphic density wuth 326ppi at the screen size of 4&quot; because most of the market phone is apply less ppi with bigger screen size means less detail when the screen is being zoom in? iphone 5 is without nfc function which is one of the surprise that as we compare with the rumor but believe there is reasons behind. may be one of the issue is the e-wallet is not yet common in market and this function may appear in the coming iphone. with al the specs reveal in the iphone 5, i truely believe apple is making a phone that is sincerely design for all user but not sertain group of people and everything design is base on quality, productivity, and performance. credit to iphone 5 and apple team.</text>

    <text>also if anyone still thinks phones don't need nfc then just imagine this... you buy nfc tags for about $2 each and on s3 etc you can install apps to make the phone do anything you want when you just wave the phone past a tag. so maybe have a tag on your car keys so you just wave phone over them and it activates bluetooth and connects to car. or you wave past another tag and it opens your music player or calendar or basically have tags all over so your phone automatically does whatever you like just by being in a certain place. now i'm sure some of you iphone owners would really like that but apple decided no... but i'm just waiting for my nfc tags to arrive for my s3 and i'll tell you all then what you missing out on.</text>

    <text>at the end of the day i have a galaxy s3, galaxy note and have pre ordered the iphone 5 and it's not about the specs of the phone that makes it it's the interface and quality build of it  the galaxy s3 is an awesome phone and i won't be getting rid of it when the iphone 5 comes out but i won't be getting rid of the iphone either  as it comes down to user opinions and what it represents to u  so stop squabbling  about which is better and bit the one you want i like them all so got them  arguing about it isn't going to make apple do anything so give it a rest....god</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is an epic fail today it does not wowed many of us coz it has nothing to offer except for a little changes like 4 inch screen and 4g lte only. apple dismayed majority of people this iphone 5 is not an innovation but a little upgrade of 4s only. iphone 5 suckss</text>

    <text>you know incase anyone hasn't realised yet that even though it has a 4 inch screen most of the time you still only gonna be able to use 3.5 inches. because they just made it slightly longer for an extra row of icons but if you play any games or apps it'll have a black border down the edge so will be exactly the same size as all the older iphones, so essentially it is just a bit faster with pretty much everything else being the same quality as 4s. so when you all look at the iphone 5 just take a look at the improvements us galaxy s owners have going from sgs1&gt;2&gt;3.</text>

    <text>its a disappointment that apple issued the iphone5 in 2 versions...  one version in cdma  &amp; another in gsm/umts  i travel between asia &amp; the us territories...  i wouldn't be able to use this iphone 5 conveniently in switching bandwidths or networks.  if only apple issued this unit with all the bandwidths, i would buy this iphone5 even at blackmarket price of a thousand dollars, coz i like apple products.  after 2 months of waiting, after my iphone4 was stolen (grrr!!) , decided to buy a white 4s instead.  the samsung s3 is nice phone, but am a petite 5'2&quot; female with small hands... kinda hard to grip the s3 properly.</text>

    <text>people won't understand the power of apple. they are not thinking clearly, i have a samsung galaxy s2 and it's boring man... there are nothing better than the appstore, nothing better than the power of itunes. don't do like i did, i got android in the first place because i thought it was nice, but here i have the jelly bean, and it's buggy. shame on you people, you buy apple not because of the specs, it's because of the software, idjits. software really does matter, without good working apps, nicely designed games, our phone is nothing. i have been struggling to get a fully working android app, but oh man it's all laggy, it has issues, bugs bugs bugs... why do you want to buy a galaxy s 3 to install a custom os? why? because the os is crap, and if you get a custom os then it's much more crap... noone here in this world can produce an innovative os like the ios except apple. so, i suggest you guys choose apple, because it's a phone meant to work, to do business, serious stuff, it doesn't die on the way, it does not shut down, it doesn't do crazy stuff, and it doesn't have force closes. so i had a very good lesson here. and that is i choose the software not the hardware. thank you.</text>

    <text>well.. at least the back seems more resistant than the glass one on the previous model.. its a start right?  no... now speaking more serious, despise all things this smartphone has and has not, in overall its a good model.  the real problem here is the higher expectation created by apple to the world about its products, and when finnaly releases anything, we are expecting something innovative, unique, better than the rest of the gadgets in the world. well people this time apple didnt went over the expectation line and thats causing a big disapointment... well ate least to most of the people except apple zealots. but remember folks, although its not the best smartphone atm in the market it still is a great smartphone</text>

    <text>the reason applefans like us are disapponted is because after all the wait and hype...after apple has bragged to the whole world that they are no.1 and that they are original...the only thing they came up with is a mediocre iphone...sure its not a bad phone...but certainly its not the best smartphone out there...apple failed their promise of delivering the best smartphone of 2012 to us loyal fans...and for that apple will charge us $800.00+ for a phone with outdated specs...i will never consider iphone 5 as a true iphone...shame on tim cook and apple for this disappointing crap!</text>

    <text>gsma's first impressions of the new iphone 5.. and i qoute &quot;on the negative side, the iphone 5 screen is only 4 inches big, and not only this, but only height was added, which, for instance, would bring no real benefit in most games and would help web browsing only in landscape mode. the camera is mostly the same as on the 4s, and lte connectivity in europe is still as scarce as water in the sahara to be really worth it. finally, the new sleeker connectivity jack renders all previous docking accessories obsolete and yet, provides no intercompatibility with the all-reigning microusb. not to mention the new nano sim card, which would be a major pain in the butt, if youve got an unlocked iphone and youd like to swap sims frequently.  honestly, im already tired of hearing apples stale remarks how the new iphone or the new ipod was apples best thing so far. what i wanted to see today on stage was pure innovation, something that would again open new doors and make other manufacturers lose their breath in trying to catch up.  instead, what i got was a predictable phone with unexciting specs; a phone that i would hardly call cutting edge, top-of-the-line, and all those labels that usually go hand in hand with apples latest. after all, the iphone has always been the most expensive sim-free smartphone on the market.  sure, people will probably continue to buy it in millions, since once its out, it would be the most sensible buy, if you are after an iphone. but i still have that bad taste in my mouth. the iphone 5 failed to meet my expectations. i didnt have a feature wishlist, except perhaps a seriously bigger screen. but most of all, i expected to be surprised. well, none of these two things happened. and i wonder, whos to blame? is it me, or is it apple thats changing into a conservative phone maker, who likes to play it safe like nokia used to, before it became clear its not getting them anywhere.  im more than sure that somebody in south korea is having a big party right now. more than anything, it feels like this years iphone is apple skipping a turn a second year in a row all the while android and windows phones have been seriously upping their game&quot;.... ouch</text>

    <text>while apple's shipping estimates on iphone 5 pre-orders quickly slipped to two weeks just an hour after the online store reopened earlier, the company's u.s. carrier partners have seen their supplies holding up a bit better with continued estimates of delivery on launch day on september 21.  that appears to be changing now, as verizon is the first of the three major u.s. carriers to see its shipping estimates slip with new pre-orders now estimated to arrive on september 26.</text>

    <text>buy iphone 4s and sell it to i-fans. say that is iphone 5. they will believe it anyway as long there is apple logo on the back. no wonder apple sue samsung, grocery store, cafe just because apple say the logo looks like apple and bla bla bla. iphone 5 is the proof that apple to busy sue other companies. even the picture leaked almost few months ago. i think iphone 5 just like editing old iphone 4s picture and resize it. make it look thinner &amp; longer, give upgrade to hardware, replace the camera position &amp; change the glass cover to almunium because if the phone fall we can't see spider web on our phone &amp; of course apple knew that iphone 5 can't win to fight with the others so they change the port. so people need to buy new port + the phone it self. this is how apple doing their works now. i believe in 6 months - 1 year later apple will showing us new iphone 5s which is just another upgrade from iphone 5 and so on till apple broke and realize. better look forward and prepare than to look back and regret. i hope apple understand what i said. no offense to the i-fans cause they are a loyal customer even inside their mind &amp; their heart knew that iphone 5 is a fail phone but some of them still buying this silly product which another $300 phone can do the same or even better. god bless you all :)</text>

    <text>we cannot deny that there are handsets on the market with much greater spec than the i phone 5. however we must realise that apple is a giant as a manufacturer and their large prices are generally a result of buying into the brand rather than the product. much like a weekly shop in tescos would be considerably cheaper than marks &amp; sparks. granted there doesnt seem to be much difference in spec between the 5 and 4s, other than a handful of perks, however &quot;if its not broken why fix it?&quot;.</text>

    <text>apple's new a6 chip is a dual core arm cortex a15 cpu with quad core gpu.    from the article:  &quot;the site added, &quot;this is a huge deal because it means apple beat both ti and samsung on bringing a15s to market.&quot;  previous generations of the apple-designed chips used in ios devices used arm cortex-a8 (the ipad / iphone 4 a4) and cortex-a9 (ipad 2 / iphone 4s a5) processor cores. the cortex-a15 is the next major jump for the arm architecture, which calls the core &quot;the highest-performance licensable processor the industry has ever seen.&quot;</text>

    <text>iphone5 very disappointing, you now have to wait to get it:  just an hour after pre-orders for the iphone 5 went live, apple store shipping estimates for new pre-orders have already slipped to two weeks in the u.s., u.k., canada, germany, and australia. once transit times are accounted for, users pre-ordering now may not receive their iphones until nearly two weeks after the official launch date of september 21.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is the best among ios running smart phones(only apple).gs 3 is one of the best android 4.1 running smart phones.both runs on different platforms.so you can't compare them.(like we can't compare mac with stupid windows running pcs) but from experience ios is far more advanced,simple,user friendly and performs better than android.</text>

    <text>well i dont c the worth for this phone. i would rather stick to my iphone 4s rather than picking this one up. also with a vast variety of smartphones in the market, i dont see that iphone5 will be a massive hit. also considering it vast pricey just because its apple, woah - sorry , been an apple fane for years now, this is totally one of its disgraceful invents.  but never the less, the new ipod touch 5th gen is surely gonna be a hit as its fresh new look with vibrant colors would race to the number 1 spot compared to all other mp3 &amp; mp4 players.  a big thumps down to i5 :( :(</text>

    <text>i am android user but iphone is argumentatively beautiful.if iphone is not that good you and me will not talk on that.iphone 5 cannot be compared with any phone even i tried to make it down but i failed bcoz iphone is king of smart phones.....people are going crazy and now the iphone 5 is the slimmest smartphone in the world. i have find somany mistakes but they make their own designs and own processor and own software. actually samsung is never been in the mobile world but once it got the taste of mobile industry with google android they jumped and the sales went up high. but iphone is started from 2007 and its still people are mad. in usa people doesnt care whether samsung galaxy or htc touch like mine they care whether you have and iphone or not. i have htc hd2 bigger of all phones but i dont get that feel from within its like drving a maruti thinking it is mercedez</text>

    <text>in your face iphone, it's either iphones innovations were leaked or it's just too behind. my galaxy s3 has more usefull features than iphone 5. more sensors, more pixels, more memory flexibility, its painfull to stick to the losing team even if u see that u going nowhere, lets stop being brand loyal and buy what works best for us. u dnt hav to stick to iphones just coz u afraid to change. s3 rocks yeah!</text>

    <text>guys read the dictionary definition of innovation :- the introduction of something new.  any sized screen is not new, it's just bigger or smaller. a faster processor is not innovative just faster at doing things.  the iphone 5 is innovative because of the way it's made, using techniques and processes not used to make phones before. yes their are less innovations here than in previous models, but never has a phone been created this well, this precise, this beautiful.  if the screen works well for the ui and usability of the device, and if the processor is fast enough for smooth operation, who gives a damn which is faster or bigger?  however, the design language is looking old now and nokia's lumia is looking fresher, wtih the pureview cameras having innovative features for a smartphone. :)  apple's ios still rocks and is by far the most secure, robust and easy to use ui out there, never mind its great eco system of games, apps, music, films etc</text>

    <text>honestly, most apple fans would not care if the iphone 5 was the same thickness as the iphone 4s but came in the new design maintaining the micro sim which is more flexible as a world phone. it would have been a true world phone supporting all networks with the current micro sim and supporting normal sims that can be cut into a micro sim. but no!!! they have to make the sim even smaller and 15% thinner so that even if you cut a normal usim it may still not fit in the iphone 5. in some countries where usims are not even available (only the large chip is available) you can't even use the device as the chip area is still too big. as for the usim available only countries even if you cut it to fit you would have to sand it down by 15% and risk a big chance of it not working. if only it would have kept the micro sim, it would have been the perfect device supporting all networks worldwide along with the new lte networks.</text>

    <text>i was there at the iphone 5 releasing ceremony yesterday. and by god i was soo excited that i hadn't been this excited for sooooo long! and the excitement breaks down into this huge disappointment when i saw the iphone. at least this is not what i had expected. yes the screens nice, the phone looks well built but it misses that charm. that charm that the iphone 4 had. and the iphone 4 was a real revolution in the industry and there was this huge hope, all of the journalists that this would too change the world of smartphone, but it didn't. doesn't look like it moved it an inch.  i had seen the iphone 5 much before its release and by god i never thought that those would even resemble the iphone. but it did. the r&amp;d didn't try this time.  the phones just the same when it comes to processing power, looks, camera and etc. just that it has a tad bigger screen and the back is two toned. except that. the phones the same. update your 4s to ios 6 and you have the iphone 5. the only difference it's got is lte on board. and don't expect it to have a &quot;quad-core&quot; with supercharges on board. as there is no quad-core processor that supports lte. so most probably a dual-core krait with adreno 225 on ye hardware side. not a bad choice. but not what i expected.  really disappointed with this one. i wish steve jobs was still with us. he revolutionized the industry with his innovations. don't think tim is doing the same.  well i would prefer the nokia lumia 920/820 or even the samsung galaxy s3 over this phone. i would tell you people to do the same. hopefully apple stops playing safe.  miss you steve.</text>

    <text>hi frndz,  about apple product i say there is no one can beat it because they always innovated and explore new things, now if we are talking about iphone5 one thing i want 2 tell the iphone start since 2007 and samsung and other brands reach to apple iphone around 5 years, now if we talk about comparison of apple and other brand, i let u know some fact    1. flash memory: - apple gives on flash memory which to much fast, give very good performance other phone also provided up to 32 gb expandable but its created phone speed slow , some time gets hang  2.processer  :- apple processer is to much higher for gaming if any one belongs animation or higher graphics industry the i let u know one fact ,heavy animation  and render only  mac machine because they to much faster ,and game is amazing if u wants to feel difference play temple run game with apple and android mobile u easily feel speed difference apple provide to much speed in every high end game   3. games: - samsung games most of the time around 1 mb to 300 mb which means its not made by heavy graphics and usually iphone high end games around 500 mb to 3 gb  4. free application: - most of the android user has some misconception about free games or apps available in android market but for u r information i tell u one thing when i saw nfs games cost in android market the cost is 542 rs and same games in app store is 2.99 usd which means around 150 rs and the most popular games temple run come first in apple then appear in play market    5. iphone provided light ambient sensor other phone doesnt  6. compass apps is to accurate   7.iphone song format apple provided much more refined mp3 song format from itunes but other phone play mp3 format which is some noisy   8. camera: - to much high quality rather then sony, samsung, its my personal experience and i m camera man and animator also  9.touch screen :-screen is immediate responsive</text>

    <text>apple is indeed heads over heals the smartest, at least the smartest smart phone company in the world. bar none.  they know, it's pointless to purposly make a phone that is stronger then the s3.  because they know, in a month or 2, samsung will just make another phone that is stronger then it, so no matter what apple does, samsung will just make another phone, that has higher specs.  so theres no point in making a phone with &quot;high&quot; specs, but a phone that is good enough for everything you need to do.  just loving these idiot haters at full force, thinking &quot;specs&quot; is everything.</text>

    <text>applied technologies that i want to see on a smart phone: -usb port, for charging, for usb on the go, for other peripherals. -front facing camera, for video calls and video chat. -memory card reader, for memory expansion and easier data transfer. -hdmi port, tv out. -3.5mm jack, tv out (like what nokia did), charging (like on the ipod shuffle). -solar cell, for charging the phone while not in use. -full flash support. -speakers, location intended for multi media applications. -document editor, preloaded. - built in radio and tv receiver -scratch, dust, shock and water proof -taser, for self defense (especially for women). -laser, or better yet a light saber or beam saber.  i wonder, how much it will cost?</text>

    <text>ha ha, you guys r so in love with apple,i got both iphone 4s and samsung note,i know the difference cause i had a hands on experience, being a previous apple lover,i had to give favour to samsung, besides ill become fan to that brand which can give us better technology with a reasonable price.apple eaters, being in love is good and sacred, but being blindly in love is foolish and unethical, look i know samsung lacks in some aspect of technology against apple, and i'm not ashamed of admitting it, but overall, samsung beats apple, and even though you guys don't admit it,deep down in your mind, you know that i'm telling the truth, and macbook is in the market for some duration of time,give ultrabook that time, cause you know,i know, ultrabook is better, there is no shame in admitting and admiring the truth.</text>

    <text>lumia 920 vs galaxy s3 vs iphone 5  call quality - lumia, 99% sure with nokia phones signal reception - lumia, same as above build quality - lumia design - lumia/iphone 5 camera - lumia, pureview camera with optical image stabilization (floating lens) and best for low light shots. both iphone 5 and galaxy s3 use software image stabilization instead of hardware like on the lumia. screen - lumia, puremotion hd+ is the most fluid (2.5x faster than current screen), the brightest, and the best for viewing outdoor with clearblack polarizer layer technology. lumia 920 is the first with synatics advanced touchscreen that works with gloves, keys, fingernails, etc... audio recording - lumia, haac rich recording with 3 distortion free high amplitude microphones. music quality through headphone jack - leaning toward galaxy s3 because it has the wolfson audio chip, though the lumia has dolby digital plus headphone enhancement. iphones have great audio quality with iphone 4/4s.</text>

    <text>apple 4s is the last iphone for me (owned every model from the original to the 4s except the 4).  they should have gone with micro usb instead of another custom connector, or at the very least used the existing connector so everyone's existing iphone/ipod/ipad add-on gear can still be used or micro usb gear could be used.  also, tired of the bs with itunes when i try to sync music, contacts, video with multiple computers and multiple iphones (work computer, home mac, work notebook) - how ignorant is apple to think that one person would only have 1 iphone and not want the same contacts/music/videos synced on each?  there's a better way apple and your proprietary icloud is not it (i have no problem syncing between multiple computers or phones when using my samsung or htc).  look to some of your competitor's solutions.  speaking of samsung...they'll be filing suit against apple for lte licensing infringement in the near future unless an agreement is reached out of court.  samsung wins this time around (read up on the lte patents samsung holds before you make a stupid comment).</text>

    <text>after the death of steave jobs, apple is just a toy making company. we expect more than this from iphone5 but it seems like a toy for kids. s3 and lumia920 is much better than iphone5. i suggest everyone to go for s3 or lumia920.</text>

    <text>apple still first company to use a15 in a chip others failed..  with the launch of iphone 5 apple has become the first mobile company to launch the arms cortex a15 cpu into the market. a very skilled person when it comes to semiconductors, anand lal shimpi of anandtech, also gave his comments on the powerful cpu. he said, based on the performance gains, apples history of soc naming and some other stuff weve heard recently, it looks like apple has integrated two arm cortex a15 cores on samsungs 32nm lp hk+mg process. he further said that it is a very large jump for apple while beating samsung and texas instruments (ti) at the same time.  apart from ti and samsung, nvidia and broadcom was also in league to release a15s but have failed. all the four companies mentioned above had made a statement to release a15s in exynos 5250 for samsung, tegra 4 (code-named wayne) for nvidia, a system-on-chip by broadcom, tis omap5 application processor but apple did it first. arms two cortex-a15 cores along with two mail gpu cores are expected to be present in samsungs exynos 5.  source,</text>

    <text>after looking at the specs, i bought an sg3. while apple sued samsung because of copyright, i think the real reason is that apple knows its losing the fight. thats why they are going to sue google aswell. iphone is a dinosaur and is using its money and pedigree to fight others into submission.  galaxy s3 = quad core 1.4ghz iphone 5 = a6 (wont even tell us speed)  you squished your phone to look like something its not, added some shiny words, and put a 5 on the box. congratulations!  i sell phones and know that even though the iphone 5 is a waste of money, people will line up around the block to get one, then have it for a week, and hate it, but keep it because its an &quot;iphone&quot;... time to wake up people! htc and samsung are here to save our souls!</text>

    <text>to all those who say this phone is going to outsell all others: of course it is, its apple and they have enough follwers that will buy every new phone that comes out. but realistically, this phone is not much different than its predecessors and really isn't very impressive if you know your technology (which most of the market does not). my facebook news feed is exploding with girls saying &quot; ordered my iphone 5 yayyyy,&quot; thing is, they don't know anything about phones, they probably can't even tell you the screen size or camera pixelage. all that to say, don't measure this phone by its popularity, if you wanna miss out on better phones, then go right ahead and buy this one.</text>

    <text>there are actually some incredible facts regarding the iphone 5 which hasn't sunk in to certain people yet who keep calling it a stretched iphone 4s.  the phone is made out of metal yet it is lighter than the sgs3. the phone is actually thinner than the sgs3 (i don't think people realize this yet) the black version is beautiful with anodized aluminum and darkened side panels. it is actually the matte black phone that i've been wishing for, it just oozes dark knight. reminds me of another beautiful phone, the black lumia 800.  there are brilliant phones coming to the market now, but samsung fans need to understand that the sgs3 is now boring and dinosaur because it is seriously being hammered by lumia 920 with innovation, and xperia tx for power, even before going head to head with iphone 5 lol.</text>

    <text>that's what happens when apple tries to save a few dollars in manufacturing costs instead of giving you a phone that's worth $1000. because they can make an easy $100m by giving you the most basic phone possible and using their crazy good marketing skills to convince people it's good.</text>

    <text>i have a gut feeling that the a6 processor is only dual core which is why apple did not make any remarks to the total cores, processor speed etc during the announcement. this was probably due to the fact that it might have affected the share prices of the company until launch date of iphone 5. we'll soon find out but i'm willing to bet anything that it's only dual core.</text>

    <text>well iphone 5 is finally here-was it worth waiting for? in one word no ! a year in the making and still 1 year behind samsung s3. samsung are already working on s4, apple give up now, if that's your best effort then your reign is over, the whole world waited and it need not have bothered, apple is getting left behind slowly and as time by goes on the gap will get bigger unless they get a design team with more imagination, more style and flair and dream up better spec phones to keep up with the competition. 3 phones on the trot now and they all look the same, gee the head designer must have an easy 24 months in his office, good job samsung paid out 1 billion dollars, should compensate for all the 4 &amp; 4s customers who have just realised they don't need to bother upgrading their phone!</text>

    <text>i think apple has reinforced the general view of a changing market, that is the impact of the arrival of wp8.  if ms has learned anything from the apple business model, hopefully wp8 is fully integrated business machine.  if so it will certainly capture a large percentage share of the total market.  frankly i was impressed with the advances with say with the nokia 920, and a little let down with iphone 5 not with standing apples overall great user experience.</text>

    <text>iphone 5 is a great device indeed with an 4 inch retina display,a better siri,hd front camera,apple's a6 processor which is quad core (i think),but the main reason i will not be able to buy this is because of it's huge price,it is not worth paying so much money for this phone,i can buy gs3 instead or wp8 phones for a lesser price than iphone 5.the price is going to be almost the same or even more for iphone 5 as it was for 4s,which is more than 40000 indian rupees,that's the reason why most people go for android as it not that expensive and it offers tons of features which iphone doesn't have at a lower price,also we in india don't have much profitable deals or offers on iphones like at&amp;t,t-mobile and various other providers,so we have to go for the unlocked version which is extremely expensive and we don't have 4g in india at the moment.</text>

    <text>i am disappointed in the hardware the aluminium unibody was the logical next move and i like that however just making the device longer just doesn't satisfy a 4 year wait speakers look nice but why would you move the earphone socket to the bottom, illogical i seriously wouldn't see the need to upgrade from a 4s there just isn't that much of a difference for such a long wait its unfair to the customers</text>

    <text>people... please analyse and read specs carefully before buying iphone5 so that you won't make a costly mistake.  as i understand from an article from phone arena, this iphone 5 comes in 2 versions.  one for cdma and another for gsm/umts countries. in short, if your iphone 5 version is gsm/umts , we can't use it properly when you  travel into the us or any cdma country.  i have waited near 3 months for this iphone 5, but after seeing this article,  bought an iphone4s instead just to be sure.  i am not rich enough to invest in many phones.  so mine has to be a go anywhere phone. and i am only a 5'2&quot; female with small hands. so the s3 is not a good option either.  i wonder why apple did this 2 iphone5 version?</text>

    <text>hahahaha as i have been saying to customers for over a month apple are the worst manufactuer, they big their products up to be the best in the world and because you eat every word they spout out they can hike the prices up.  the glxys3 has been out just long enough so apple can put their inferior level of tech in the phone. by everyone who works in the mobile industrie (except the ppl who have apple feaver) think/know that the glxs3 is the best phone on the market.  i personaly think anyone who gets this new version of the iphone 4 needs their heads testing, but as most of you apple heads will read this and dismiss it i say &quot;good luck to you, your new iphone4 and its 12month manufacurers warrenty&quot; hahaha.  big their products up to be the best in the world and because you eat every word they spout out they can hike the prices up.  the glxys3 has been out just long enough so apple can put their inferior level of tech in the phone. by everyone who works in the mobile industrie (except the ppl who have apple feaver) think/know that the glxs3 is the best phone on the market.  i personaly think anyone who gets this new version of the iphone 4 needs their heads testing, but as most of you apple heads will read this and dismiss it i say &quot;good luck to you, your new iphone4 and its 12month manufacurers warrenty&quot; hahaha.</text>

    <text>the iphone is a device made for people that want a quality product. galaxy s3 might be better in some aspects, but it's made of plastic. hold an iphone, you'll see the quality of the product as you touch it, touch an s3 and you will feel like breaking it if you sqeeze it too tight. also, the camera on the iphone beats everything i've ever put my hands on. from the moment 3gs came out and sony erricson didn't came with a better product with a better camera (imho they were the only competition apple had when it came to cameras). iphone lover or not, i respect a good quality product. yes, you are limited, you may not find youtube videos as you would on an s3 because they want you to buy it from itunes, they don't allow you to exchange information via bluetooth and they want you to buy all their products on applestore (if you're not jailbroken like me). but i would still choose it over an s3. the only thing i missed with the previous iphones is that they were lacking behind with the display size. and be honest, you can't say that apple couldn't have made a bigger display 3 years ago. the only reason for keeping the size of the display smaller is because steve jobs considered that a mobile phone should have some dimension limits, and i think that if he would still be alive now, he would have modified the 4s to have a bigger display without making the phone bigger. i had a galaxy nexus for 1 week. i could not wear tight jeans, and generally i could take it out of my pocket if i wasn't standing up. i don't want to mention if i had a galaxy note how would that be. retina display is an extaordinary feature that apple fist came up with. the quality and volume of the iphone is only compared with an ipod or another apple product, and i heard a lot of phones and devices. ios is a very friendly os. the map was better than most smartphones even before, i am very curious how this one will be. you can hate as much as you want. i consider this product being something i will enjoy and not feel sorry if i buy.  my 2 cents</text>

    <text>hello guys, most  of the ppl here are against of iphone5....!  i agree the new iphone is not a boom upgrade, but still its good. we are all not program developers n all.... y are you all running after  quad core?? having a quad core doesn't mean that's faster than duel cores. why we ppl need quad core while duel core does the same thing. afterall just for browsing internet,running apps, playing music, some games we need quad....?!! performance is not only depends upon processor or cpu itself.... it's rendered with the collaboration of all other hardware n software components....   i guess the more than the half of the ppl commenting here hadn't their hands on any iphone. and iphone is definitely smoother than other in overall performance. whatever the google might did with android, i have that too, ios run more  flawlessly comparing to android. definitely the new iphone given by tim is not at all worth waiting...   i'm disappointed too... but the comments of the ppl here are rolling out somewhere else...! if you want it just get it.... whatever the ppl argue, just remember iphone has standalone more than 70% of smartphone market share,n ppl will lineup to the streets before apple store to get iphone...</text>

    <text>yeah after the shocking launch of iphone 5 which was a crap but if these 5 things that could have made the iphone 5 an even better smartphone  1,expandable memory :sure, apple offers the iphone 5 with different amounts of storage space, up to 64gb, but it's way cheaper, and sometimes even more practical to just use a microsd card, which you can easily take out and insert into another device.  2,more informative, dynamic homescreen :wouldn't it be cool if the iphone 5's homescreen could show a bit more information? how about getting real-time updates on the weather, or short incoming message previews, or your next calendar events? most of these things already appear on the lockscreen, but they disappear once you unlock your handset. plus, it would be undeniably great if all that info is present right on the homescreen as well. oh well, maybe in a future ios release...  3, nfc :nfc is not included in the iphone 5, which means we're in for another painful year for mobile payments and other nfc applications. probably waiting until the time is right, apple will not give the thumbs up to nfc for at least another 12 months.  4,wireless charging :there can be no argument here, wireless charging is a great convenience. just place your iphone on the neatly-designed charging pad and it's all set - no need to connect cables or anything like that. it just works! well, not really, because apple is yet to adopt such technology.  5,water- and dust-resistant coating :you've probably heard of these new water- and dust-proof coatings. they make your handset that much more resistant to the elements, without altering the its gorgeous looks one bit. sadly, even though the iphone 5 is one incredibly well-designed and constructed device, it still doesn't have such a coating, meaning you'll still have to handle it with extreme care.</text>

    <text>people never seem to learn from history. apple had never competed on tech specs (even though on that front they are more than competent). iphone philosophy is invisible technology which allows the user to focus on apps and getting things done.  don't like it? it doesn't work for you? buy an android, or buy a wp8. they are also brilliant. one thing you mut get through your heads, apple will continue pursuing this philosophy and will not simply adopt whatever tech for tech's sake. it will use what is useful, and what it believes is useful.  plus what do you haters have to worry? according to you guys apple is dying tomorrow anyway right? ;)</text>

    <text>more of the same, apple just tried to match the competition with the iphone, but this phone really does not do the competition and better (galaxy s3/note 2 and lumia 920)? facetime without wi-fi? (competition with other applications makes it long ago) panoramic camera (for years there are hundreds who do, the galaxy s2 which was released in february 2011 does), 4 &quot;screen after so praised was his old 3.5&quot; because it was &quot;perfect&quot;? (only lengthened to go from being in a television format of the old with 3:2 to 16:9 aspect ratio which is used in all screens for almost a decade and in all competition for smartphones years), has integration with facebook? (competition integration with any application, not just facebook, makes me cringe that improves mention in his presentation as revolutionary), changed the charging port? (only becomes obsolete all devices you have with the old port or use the adapter will cost 29 euros ...) processor updated (it fair to try to adapt to 2012 and still remains in last place against competition) what else has? any other developments to compare with the competition? no .. nothing, even has the same battery, with a larger screen is used up more quickly than does the 4s ... and pity that the great innovations that have made &amp;#8203;&amp;#8203;smart competition have not deigned nor some even match or take a self ... open your eyes people</text>

    <text>i'm surprised they kept the edge-to-edge glass. i call it easy-to-break glass.  how hard is it to smash the phone when the glass is almost protruding out of its casing? iphone 4 / 4s was one of the most broken phones in terms of percentage of cracked screens thanks to the easily cracked glass, even from regular height drops.  apple needs to reinstate the much more impact-resistant iphone / 2g / 3g / 3gs design, it is irrational to build a phone that breaks with occasional drops, it's like blackmailing people into buying thicker phone covers and bumpers.  which defeats the purpose of the thin phone.</text>

    <text>even gsma are disappointed and i quote &quot;on the negative side, the iphone 5 screen is only 4 inches big, and not only this, but only height was added, which, for instance, would bring no real benefit in most games and would help web browsing only in landscape mode. the camera is mostly the same as on the 4s, and lte connectivity in europe is still as scarce as water in the sahara to be really worth it. finally, the new sleeker connectivity jack renders all previous docking accessories obsolete and yet, provides no intercompatibility with the all-reigning microusb. not to mention the new nano sim card, which would be a major pain in the butt, if youve got an unlocked iphone and youd like to swap sims frequently.  honestly, im already tired of hearing apples stale remarks how the new iphone or the new ipod was apples best thing so far. what i wanted to see today on stage was pure innovation, something that would again open new doors and make other manufacturers lose their breath in trying to catch up.  instead, what i got was a predictable phone with unexciting specs; a phone that i would hardly call cutting edge, top-of-the-line, and all those labels that usually go hand in hand with apples latest. after all, the iphone has always been the most expensive sim-free smartphone on the market. &quot;</text>

    <text>i concur the htc one x is a great phone, much nicer and much better than the s3 which it's cheap parts and no name manufacturers while htc has beats audio, nvidia and other well known companies hardware in their phones. still tough the iphone is more reliable, stable, smoother, apps work better and that's an undeniable fact and they don't need a quad core cpu. android has to many platforms unlike apple who has 1 and that's the problem with their android os.</text>

    <text>before buying this istone5,please know what a galaxy note 2 can do  - the new galaxy note recognizes when users remove its stylus. when you pull out the so-called s pen, the device will switch to a customized home screen that highlights stylus-focused applications. the device also recognizes if you shut it off without replacing the stylus; in such cases, it will remind you to do so.  -because of their small screens, smartphones rarely place applications or documents in windows like you would see on a desktop computer. instead, pages and programs generally run full-screen. but the galaxy note 2 is trying to bring back windowed applications  -the new version has a 5.5-inch screen, which is slightly bigger than the originals 5.3-inch display. thanks to the extra pixels, the display has a 16:9 ratio, meaning that when you watch high-definition movies on it, you wont see any black borders.  -the new device did have some cool photography features. its got a built-in burst mode that will take up to 20 shots at once. it also has a group-photo feature that will allow you to take a picture of a group of people, will instantly recognize the faces of people in the photo and allows you to choose from several different selections to find the best image of each persons face. the facial recognition was spotty  it didnt recognize peoples faces unless they were looking close to directly at the camera  and the feature took several seconds to take and process the photo. hope u can realise how much samsung is trying to give more innovative and user friendly devices.</text>

    <text>many people are just trolling here without even putting their unlucky hands on an iphone.most of the people are stupid . they just want bigger and bigger specs.what is this nonsense , don't get caught to specs .just see how efficient most of the apple devices are.if the a6 chip can bring an equivalent performance or even greater than a quadcore. who needs quad core. guys please understand ,the firmwares are different.android is completely different from ios even they shares common ui features ,apps etc. also understand you need a quadcore to process heavy processes .but in apple,as a6 can do the same job using lower specs .who cares. believe me or not gs3 gets slower than iphone 4s sometimes. by the way i own both :p .(me :-android/ios app developer )</text>

    <text>what an absolute joke......,......  took a whole year to introduce the slightest chenges to an iphone 5.  bigger screen, not nfc, same camera, similar design.  the only real benefit is the lte support. which will come with many other handsets within a few months.  i feel sorry for all the deluded apple users hanging on to a once number 1 handset about 3 years ago.  time to move on with the changes.  apple dont invent they reinvent.  joke</text>

    <text>the whole story about this iphone 5 reveals that this apple leadership is dull minded.they can never fool the millions of informed smartphone users.apple is going down.let apple install visioneries and patent them so that no one copies or steals them,otherwise the future of the iphone brand is doomed in the long run.</text>

    <text>i had a hands-on experience with sgs3 having a quadcore processor. to my surprise the screen's responsiveness is somehow comparable to my itouch4 having only dual core a4 chip. the screens resolution is not also as catchy as the vivid retina display. there are also extra icons/apps which are not often usable or maybe irrelevant(for androids). its pebble design is a no for me, plastic casing is not worth the price. gorilla glass is ok, camera and large display is ok. the bottomline: there are pros and cons between ip5 and sgs3.</text>

    <text>i don't get it. why would apple put a product launch a product and not give the most important info for customers: cpu power, ram graphics, battery. twice the cpu power, faster graphics, more battery life is just marketing trash. how can i preorder a phone that i know nothing about. i'll just take apple's word for it? like they said about the 4s battery... 200 hours standby? the 4s was a big dissapointment for me. the iphone 5 has 225 hours. so that means 36-48 hours max. i believed the hype. not anymore!!!</text>

    <text>apple is a walkn dead company....this so called iphone5 is just another version of iphone4s with lesser features. i cannot believe it didn't come with features like nfc,radio,no youtube,crap battery, no picasa integration, no predictive text input swipe, no java, no simultaneous hd video and image recording and am yet to confirm if it's quadcore....it's worse dan crap. total waste of money. i'll go for s3</text>
