They consider jailbreaking a dangerous and daunting task that may eventually void their warranty. Since I\u2019m on the other side of that barricade, I\u2019ve put down a nice list of the 10 new features you will get if you go for jailbreaking. The benefits are more than ten, but I\u2019ve compiled the most major ones.", " \r\n", " \r\nJailbreaking is a software process that unlocks the access to the iPhone original system files so that you can modify some of them for the better. You shouldn\u2019t confuse it with a carrier unlock. Jailbreaking allows us to unleash the true power of the Apple\u2019s iPhone. ", " \r\n", " \r\nGetting your iPhone jailbroken is like getting a totally different device \u2013 at least software-wise.

I am not to be held responsible for any damage you may inflict to your iPhone.", " \r\n", " \r\n1. Multitasking", " \r\n", " \r\nThe first new benefit from jailbreaking is surely true multitasking.

It neither manufactures the components nor assembles them into a finished product. The components come from a variety of suppliers and the assembly is done by Foxconn, a Taiwanese firm, at its plant in Shenzhen, China. The \u201cteardown\u201d graphic below, based on data from iSuppli, a market-research firm, shows who makes what inside the iPhone, and how much the various bits cost. Samsung turns out to be a particularly important supplier. It provides some of the phone's most important components: the flash memory that holds the phone's apps, music and operating software; the working memory, or DRAM; and the applications processor that makes the whole thing work. Together these account for 26% of the component cost of an iPhone.", " \r\n", " \r\nThis puts Samsung in the somewhat unusual position of supplying a significant proportion of one of its main rival's products, since Samsung also makes smartphones and tablet computers of its own. Apple is one of Samsung's largest customers, and Samsung is one of Apple's biggest suppliers. This is actually part of Samsung's business model: acting as a supplier of components for others gives it the scale to produce its own products more cheaply. For its part, Apple is happy to let other firms handle component production and assembly, because that leaves it free to concentrate on its strengths: designing elegant, easy-to-use combinations of hardware, software and services."], "type": "\r\nU", "user": "cheapchinaiphones"},

I was excited to install the iOS as I was looking forward to a revamped look at the new features. After 24h I want to revert. The beta is extremely stable so this has nothing to do with bugs or anything. The look is just very young, and has taken apple closer to Android / Windows but in the worse way possible. People who bought iPhones bought them to belong to a certain brand, that had a defined look and yes the Androids of this world always had better features but that was not the point. Now when I look at my iphone, I don't feel like I have an Apple product anymore. Apple was uncompromising under Jobs, \"take it or leave it\". With this new design, Apple is not innovating, they are turning in another the direction and following the pack. I never thought I would say this in 2013, but blackberry may have a play to make here in wooing serious phone users, people who want a unique UI, and people who just like to differentiate themselves from the mass.

Been using nokia since 2000. I could choose between s4 s3 and htc one. I took a good friends advice and settled with the iphone. I honestly must say that im amazed. The camera on the phone is brilliant, it records like a video camera. Also its really easy and intuitive to use. Everything seems to be where t should. Android based phones are more juiced up lets say but the feel and usage of the iphone are unbelivable. Furthermore it doesnt lag, i can open all my apps and still get the same response ehen wrtting an email or playing a video game. I have some cons also. The baterry life is poor in my opinion, you can use the phone for just one day with wifi and 3g on. Ive been used with my e72 which could go on for a matter of several days.

But for me wireless charging is not for me. For me even the notification light is one the best ideas. it could save time & even ur battery life.. Unlike the iphne ul need to unlock the screen to check if u have a msg or miscall & that activates ur screen sucking energy. U see other companies able to squeeze that in there products. Yes they made ur led flash blink wen u have a notification but that was it. Why cant they put an led in the home button or even at the side.

With all the power of quad core , the S3 still hangs and stops for a second or so while opening an app or a picture after the jelly bean update. All this happens for everyday use and not while gaming.  Finally I have started to understand iOS and its simplicity. It works flawless and is pleasing to look at.

Only hardware. If you look at android phones, all software basically the same. So the choice is hardware...make, model, price etc etc. Apple is the only product in the market that is not dependent to someone else for software reliability, features etc. So, it's not so complicated anymore! The smartphone market and smartphones in particular, are controlled by the operating system. Android phones are dependent on what Google gives them, Nokia is dependent on Microsoft. That leaves me to a logic choice that Apple's combination is more acceptable. The specs, performances and looks are personal. But the os is the deciding point. All android phones are working with the same basic os. And windows need to prove itself. Master of os, belle/symbian, is not on the market in the near future.

I  bought iPhone 5 only because I had invested a lot in apple ecosystem (iPad, mac). I have used 4 & 4s both. The only diff in 4s and five is screen and also it's light. Speed in not a much diff in 4s and 5. I was badly waiting for next gen android 1080p screens and BB10 but couldn't wait longer. And I think in 3-4 months when these will be out iph5 will be kinda old thing. If battery is a concerned then its nothing in front of sgn2 & and screen ( only drawback SGN has is the green tone in browser ).

Scrolling through a picture library feels like something is holding it back.I have the Iphone 5 16GB. No matter how many apps are open in the background, everything simply works instantly. No lagging whatsoever. It just works. No need to reboot every couple of days like Android. Apple is more stable and more efficient than any Android i've seen up to date. Like I said, nothing wrong with the hardware....Android is the problem. Unfortunately the general public seems to like the extra \"fancyness\" of Android, but the simple, sleek operation, look and feel of IOS is so much more efficient.

{"date": "2012-12-19 12:48", "rating": "0", "review": ["\r\n\r\n\r\niPhone 5 is the successor of the iPhone 4s. For many, the iPhone 5 may be the best gadget out there. But if you look closely, it's not as good as you think. First of all, the iPhone 5 is extremely expensive. The iPhone 5 tear down suggests that it would take Apple only around 178$ to manufacture one iPhone 5. From there we can get a idea how expensive Apple have tagged their products with.\u00a0", " \r\nMost of all, iPhone 5 lacks flexibility. Although iPhone 5 is powered by Bluetooth 4.0, you can't do basic thing like transfer file from one device to another. You still have to be dependent\u00a0upon\u00a0 iTunes for file transfer. The User Interface looks dull and boring as it always looked. The still aren't home screens to swype through. The notification bar doesn't give you quick access to settings. You have to go through a hefty process just to change your ring tone.", " \r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00ad\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00ad\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00ad\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00ad\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00ad\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00ad\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Apple has finally increased the size of iPhone to 4 inch, that may not be enough for hard core smartphone users . At least, a 4.3 inch screen would have done the job. Though the screen size has been increased all the apps from the Apple Store are not optimized for iPhone 5. So, we see back empty spaces in many of the applications. Apple decided to remove Google Maps and that was one of their main mistake. Google Maps is the best\u00a0navigation\u00a0software so far. Like the iPhone 4s, iPhone 5 has most of it's part made of glass. If you drop it once, don't be surprised if a part of the phone is cracked. Some people say why not keep protection cover but if you keep it, what's the point of having such glossy back?The iPhone 5 also lacks support of micro-sd card. That means you can't expand your device as per your wish. The 32GB and 64GB iPhone are terribly expensive. While a 32 GB micro-sd card only costs about 20$, if you want to have a 32GB iPhone instead of 16GB, you will have to pay 100$ more just for 16GB extra storage. Further, iPhone 5 lacks removable battery option which means no third party powerful battery like mugen batteries. If you travel a tot, you won't be able to carry spare battery due to closed battery cover. In addition to that, the battery life of iPhone 5 isn't that good either. You use a lot of application, then be sure that it won't even last for a day or so. iPhone 5 is no huge leap over iPhone 4s with most of the things kept same.Most of all, Apple's decision to remove Google Maps was a blunder. Apple Maps is nowhere near Google Maps is full of error.You won't get street view feature either.\u00a0Don't be fooled and never go after apple. Be smart and chose smartphone that best suits you!Honestly, if you don't go for brand name, iPhone just isn't the device for you. Keep all the things I said in mind and you will never\u00a0regret.

Then came apple, who decided to see what they can do, with a phone, and bam instinct success.  Their smartphone was the very first one to be extremely successful.  Google decided to do the same thing and programed, the highly glitched android, who to this day, still have many problems, in fact jellybean 4.2 has more problems then the previous jellybean.  THEN LG, SAMSUNG ETC ETC DECIDED TO MAKE THEIR OWN FLAT SCREEN KEYLESS PHONE THAT IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO WHAT THE IPHONE DOES BUT ON A GLITCHED ANDROID OS. I guess for you, you definely should stick with android.  To me, a phone is a phone.  It's a not a computer to me. computer needs multi tasking.   A phone shouldn't be multi tasking as in the past, phones barely mult tasked.  That being said if thats what you want, then go for a android phone.  Apple makes their products priortize important.   How often is someone doing 2 things at once, on a phone???  The fandroid counter argument is, \"MANY MANY MANY\" for the sake of arguing, even though most of the time we are probably doing only one thing at once.  It be nice for ip5 to have multi tasking, but to me its on of those things that is not necessary important. It's just fanroids continue to use the \"IT CAN MULTI TASK\" multi task = battery kill.  Yes, it kills your battery.", " \r\n", " \r\nNetwork sharing. There is network sharing on the iphone.  Not sure what crack your smoking.

Theres a reason why almost every ip5 review is such a high review.  Because it functions well, they don't review stuff like that \"widgets\" and crap like that, as stuff like that doesn't determine, the quality, the usability and overall function of the phone.  Also tech experts and program developers already know the ios is a superior and \"mastered\" os to the android as android is still having problems.  I know 2 different friends who work as developers both, of them tell me, developers focus more on ios, becuase its easier, and in the end, the app runs much better on the ios vs android.

What happened to all those cool apps and games you guys use to have?  I know multi tasking is cool, but I think your new os, is killing the battery life, as my phone drains the battery quickly.  Also your display is not as good as before.  Doesn't look as nice! Bring back your retina!!! you are saying you have 1080hd screen, but it still not as good as the ios6! wth apple! also when the hell are you going to let me update to the jelly bean 4.2!

Before I get into it, I must point out that I am a Samsung and Android fanboy, so my opinion is very colored.  So, that my disclaimer is stated, my opinion shall be stated.  I feel that this device is quite beautiful.  Who am I kidding, all iPhones are beautiful.  That said, there are many things about this device, it's design, and hardware that I don't like.  The weight and thinness of this device make it feel like a toy, and also kind of make it feel cheaper.  The black models coating scratches and scuffs far too easily for a coating of it's type.  And that screen!  Dear God, that screen!!!  Not only is it not HD (because, if Apple's \"Retina\" ambitions are anything to go by, the iPhone will never get HD), but it's size is horrible!  I'll admit, I've grown accustomed to large screens, but that 4\", 9:16 aspect ratio screen on that iPhone shape that everyone has grown accustomed to in recent years just looks small, strange, and funny.  I cannot, and will never, agree with a screen that small with a 9:16 aspect ratio.  On other devices with 9:16 aspect ratios, they may not be that much bigger than the iPhone 5 -- well, they are, but that isn't the point -- but at least the design of the BODY is done in such a way to so that it actually LOOKS right.  It looks wrong and out of place on the iPhone 5.  Bad way of implementing it.  Now, if only people would stop buying into Apple's Retina fantasy for the iPhone 5 so that it could properly compete on the screen front with its competition.  I don't care if \"Your eyes can't distinguish individual pixels\", it's still not HD.  Plus, going by the fact that most people actually have greater than 20/20 vision, Apple's so called Retina is bogus.  I hate Apple and all of their products, I hate the fact that they are trying to quell competition, but it doesn't mean I don't want them to properly compete in the mobile realm.  If they can actually begin to innovate again, and stop trying to kill competition, they are more than welcome in my books."], "type": "\r\nH", "user": "Austin Deane"},

Smartphone has become part of me - might as well just integrate it onto my palm - and using it is not like a beauty contest between phones. Personally it'd be tiring if every iteration was revolutionary. Turn-by-turn navigation was long overdue - I love it - and the map will catch up with Google sooner than iphone haters will realise. Google map is still accessible on Safari anyway and the app offered to iphone users like myself was never good to start with. I prefer longer screens (over my 3GS) for two reasons that are important to me: (1) I see more usable list items and the (2) HD videos looks right and no longer has the annoying stretch option. You like big TV-sized screen you'll enjoy S3/HTC. The iphone 5 camera edges seems more distorted than I'd have liked and I hate the bottom position of the headphone socket.

Contrast levels and light output have both been increased, and color performance is astonishing.  The full sRGB gamut is present here, and color errors are remarkably low for a even a high end desktop display.  While many were hoping for a move to OLED or some other screen innovation, this really is a huge step up that is very easy to quantify.  To put this in perspective, in the past few years I've reviewed probably 30-40 different displays, from PC monitors, to TVs to projectors.  Not a single one, out of the box, can put up the Gretag Macbeth dE numbers that the iPhone can, and perhaps one projector (which listed for $20,000) can approach the grayscale and color accuracy out of the box.", " \r\n", " \r\nApple obviously has very high control over what parts they use and what comes off their assembly lines.  I don't know if they are having the displays individually adjusted after they are assembled, or if the quality control is very strict, or if I just got a really remarkably lucky sample.  I do know that if TV and PC Monitor vendors were able to provide displays that looked like this out of the box, professional calibrators would lose a good amount of business potentially. The new panel in the iPhone 5 is simply remarkable in quality and if it were a PC monitor, I'd give it a Gold Award on the basis of it's performance.."], "type": "\r\nU", "user": "Anonymous"},

Well for now the phone is ok but will have a rough time with the competition from galaxy 3,lumia 900&920, and even the htc 8x.

I was thinking of upgrading (from android) to iphone but when they released this new one its just disappointment. You would expect a far more superior phone in terms of 'Tech' and 'Featured Apps'. People will disagree on me on this one but its True. Check the other phones' specs and features and compare it to iphone 5. \u00a3500+ you should get what you paid for. You'll only pay for the looks (casing) of the phone but u get less from the inside. $199 starting price? Where can I find such a thing?"], "type": "\r\nU", "user": "L3inad"},

That's how you know Apple is the most adavnced efficient os yesterday, today and tomorrow and the figures don't lie.. Sit down and stay pressed. No one wants to use your 2nd rated os for shit. Developers know ios is the main stage to showcase their apps. Who the hell use NFC, no one but 0.1 percent of the Android population. Apple still manages to make a glass & aluminum beautiful slim, and litephone without using cheap plastic. Everything on android just screams 2nd rated. Gazllion over hyped features that hardly works. Apple is not going to invest in overhyped comic features that will lead to problems. That is why it did not jump on the lte bandwagon at 1st. Who in the hell gonna jump on something that is not even well establish. LTE is still growing; NFC, wireless charging are just a few. iPhone hands down has the best flawless os and polished apps. I see why Apple hasn't added anything particular new, it's because their phones and os has been always been solid especially since the iPhone 4. The iphone is the only phone to have the best camera in the mobile world today. IPhone 5 will be no exception. Android has to come out with updates every 3-6 months. Jellybean, yes is a great addition but it's still not solid. Keep on reaching! iPhone 5 is a great addition to the apple family. I love the fact that when you get an iPhone you have the latest and greatest phone for that whole year, then you have Android that constantly comes out with new better phones for their standards every month. Now u don't have the latest and greatest phone as you may think and may at times feel cheated with your 1 month old stall phone. So to end this, Samsung loses #1 spot after being the #1 smartphone for 1 month, while Apple reclaims it's throne for another full year. Enough said! "], "type": "\r\nU", "user": "Greg"},

The camera is mostly the same as on the 4S, and LTE connectivity in Europe is still as scarce as water in the Sahara to be really worth it. Finally, the new sleeker connectivity jack renders all previous docking accessories obsolete and yet, provides no intercompatibility with the all-reigning microUSB.

But most of all, I expected to be surprised. Well, none of these two things happened. And I wonder, who\u2019s to blame?

Galaxy S3 might be better in some aspects, but it's made of plastic. Hold an iPhone, you'll see the quality of the product as you touch it, touch an S3 and you will feel like breaking it if you sqeeze it too tight. Also, the camera on the iPhone beats everything I've ever put my hands on. From the moment 3GS came out and Sony Erricson didn't came with a better product with a better camera (imho they were the only competition apple had when it came to cameras). iPhone lover or not, I respect a good quality product. Yes, you are limited, you may not find youtube videos as you would on an S3 because they want you to buy it from iTunes, they don't allow you to exchange information via bluetooth and they want you to buy all their products on applestore (if you're not jailbroken like me). But I would still choose it over an S3. The only thing I missed with the previous iPhones is that they were lacking behind with the display size. And be honest, you can't say that apple couldn't have made a bigger display 3 years ago. The only reason for keeping the size of the display smaller is because Steve Jobs considered that a mobile phone should have some dimension limits, and I think that if he would still be alive now, he would have modified the 4S to have a bigger display without making the phone bigger. I had a Galaxy Nexus for 1 week. I could not wear tight jeans, and generally I could take it out of my pocket if I wasn't standing up. I don't want to mention if I had a Galaxy Note how would that be. Retina display is an extaordinary feature that Apple fist came up with. The quality and volume of the iPhone is only compared with an iPod or another Apple product, and I heard a lot of phones and devices. iOS is a very friendly os. The map was better than most smartphones even before, I am very curious how this one will be. You can hate as much as you want.

I thought in buying another iPhone, but I noticed that Apple started to sell new models of phones in short periods of time with almost no changes, and so restricting updates for older models. At that time, the last model was 3GS and I decided not to spend more money in Apple's phone because other brands started to offer more models with almost no limitations with their OS and with better specifications.

But that run is likely to come to an end. The release of iPhone 5 sparked dissapointment to fencesitters and fails to convert any Android users to join the buzz of Apple fans. The only reason why Apple is still getting that amount of spotlight, is that it's still riding out its greatest hit thanks to the now late Steve Jobs. With no new exciting features, no innovative input, enlargement of screen size (contradictory to the apparently \"PERFECT\" size as deemed before), usage of LTE (possible lawsuits by HTC and Samsung), dissapointing specs as compared to the 5 month old S3, dissapointing matchup as compared to Nokia's Lumia 920 specs, we can only aspect Apple's decline in market share which has slid to approximately 40% as of now.

Apple has not done anything out of the box and instead delivered this clunker of soon-to-be-obsolete piece of technology. We all know that Apple is not the first in the race when it comes to hardware, but even so, there is a thing such as keeping up with times. In a time when not one, but multiple smartphones are offering quad cores, dual core seems a thing of yesterday. By opting for a dual core, Apple has set itself behind the clock by a year. Sure, the new phone is decent and will manage to sell among the Apple fanbase (most probably people with iPhone 3G or 3GS), but being the trend setter, iPhone 5 leaves a lot to be desired. As one of the biggest business empires, it wouldn't hurt to invest a little more in hardware, right? And not having NFC...that's a megaLOL...I mean, even Nokia, which is trying to catch up with times has NFC sharing on it's current flagship (just for the record, I was really impressed by Lumia 920. I didn't think Nokia had it left in them.) but for the latest iPhone to not have one...I'm speechless.", " \r\nOf course, those die hard fans out there will say crap such as, \"it's the software which matters, not the hardware.\" To them I say BITCH PLEASE. To have software and not hardware is like having the mental capability to do something, but get restricted due to physical limitations. I wouldn't be surprised if most of the casual Apple fans will switch over to Android (I am one of them). The only people who will this poor excuse for a next generation iPhone will be the hardcore fans and the technically challenged (i.e. those who don't know much about technological gadgets). In other words, iPhone 5 will sell only due to Apple's brand name.

{"date": "2012-09-13 00:05", "rating": "0", "review": ["\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter owning every iPhone and being disappointed when the 4S was announced and still buying it because my purchases were locked to iTunes, I thought the next thing will blow my mind but if you look at the specifications, these were features that should have been in the iPhone 4. The reality is, don't take my word for it, this phone will be Apples demise and it's unfortunate. Every one can comment about trying \"android but then moving to iphone\" or \"iphone but then moving to android\" and you won't know if it's true or not. I have in total \u00a360 worth of purchases on iTunes. Android has 70% of market share, while Apple has less than 17% (August figures). 70% of the world can't be making bad decisions right? Brand loyalty cost me hefty. People who had iPhone 4 never bought iPhone 4S. The only people who bought iPhone 4s were people who had 3GS or people who never had an iPhone and you can ask anyone. The only people who want an iPhone are because they feel socially excluded if they don't have one. But the market share figures will tell you that it's cool to have an Android, not iPhone. I know that shouldn't affect whether you buy a phone, I just thought I'd point that out. In my opinion, Apple have been using all these gimmicks to dress up things in fancy words. iPhone 5 has the same evolution as the iPhone 4S did compared to iPhone 4. What did Apple followers say? The one after 4S will blow your mind. Now the 5 is announced, they say no no the NEXT iPhone will blow your mind. What really offended me was the profit margins. It's not a premium phone... you're only paying a premium. These phones cost around 140$ to make and Apple sell them for around 800$. Work out how much profit they're making. People keep using this term that iOS is \"polished\". I've been a LONG TERM user of iPhone and while at first it was, this line of thinking was eliminated with Androids ICS and the only ones who still deny/argue it are the ones who've never owned one. I've never owned one but I have tried it and I'm missing out on so many things. The battery life on the S2 and S3 is phenomenal. Me and my girlfriend went on a honeymoon together. She has way more friends than me and was texting and calling all day (she had the S2 and S3 with her) while my 4S only lasted 4 hours. Ask ANYONE with an iPhone. Some might say \"because of apps\". Well funny I should mention this. The average iPhone user has 50 apps while Android users have over 80. iPhones push system is more efficient than Androids but the way the iOS system is built, it kills the whole battery. Apple, rather than innovating or fine tuning their OS for battery efficiency, they claim that \"battery technology hasn't improved\". Yes that's true, but every other company make their applications and hardware make more EFFICIENT use of the battery, whereas Apple force the hardware requirements to spiral. Some will say that the iOS 6 can be installed on all previous generation iPhones. Windows XP can be installed on my 3.1 machine. But will it run though? Look on YouTube for people who updated their iPhone 3GS< to iOS6 and rendered their phone useless. I'm only mentioning this all because it's important to know that you will only get lies from Apple and empty promises. They don't care about the consumer, only profits. Whereas other manufacturers care about balancing profits with giving the user what they want. Hence why we wanted faster phones, we got quad core while Apple decided to put dual core. What the f? Anyway take this as my opinion of course, but the market share percentages are accurate, please Google them to verify. Sorry about the randomness, this box is very tiny. Hope I haven't made anyone fall asleep. Take care."], "type": "\r\nC", "user": "Jack"},
