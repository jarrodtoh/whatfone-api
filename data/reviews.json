They consider jailbreaking a dangerous and daunting task that may eventually void their warranty. Since I\u2019m on the other side of that barricade, I\u2019ve put down a nice list of the 10 new features you will get if you go for jailbreaking. The benefits are more than ten, but I\u2019ve compiled the most major ones.", " \r\n", " \r\nJailbreaking is a software process that unlocks the access to the iPhone original system files so that you can modify some of them for the better. You shouldn\u2019t confuse it with a carrier unlock. Jailbreaking allows us to unleash the true power of the Apple\u2019s iPhone. ", " \r\n", " \r\nGetting your iPhone jailbroken is like getting a totally different device \u2013 at least software-wise. And while I find it next to impossible to resist the tempting new features, I can totally understand you may have perfectly good reasons to keep your iPhone untouched. But hopefully, this list will help you convert. ", " \r\n", " \r\nAnd a word of warning! This post is not a tutorial in jailbreaking your iPhone. If you need one, a nice place to start is iClarified iPhone section. Installing unofficial third-party apps may cause unwanted side effects so always rely on your good judgment when dealing with those. I am not to be held responsible for any damage you may inflict to your iPhone.", " \r\n", " \r\n1. Multitasking", " \r\n", " \r\nThe first new benefit from jailbreaking is surely true multitasking. There is a free and a paid app that both offer task switching and management each in its own way. Both depend on a third-party app \u2013 the free Backgrounder \u2013 to do the minimizing for them. While that may sound complex, switching apps is as easy as it gets. ", " \r\n", " \r\nThe free task manager is called Kirikae and shows the running apps as a list. Tapping one will switch to it, while a finger swipe reveals a button to kill the process.", " \r\n", " \r\nMultifl0w is the paid task manager. It offers the same functionality as Kirikae, but uses a cover-flow-like view for your running apps. It\u2019s kinda like the way Safari displays the opened tabs. Multifl0w looks really fancy and even outperforms Palm Pre\u2019s Card Interface at times.", " \r\n", " \r\nLockscreen applications", " \r\n", " \r\nThanks to the several available lockscreen applications like LockInfo and IntelliScreen, you can get acess to your calls, messages, calendar events, weather information, etc. straight from the iPhone lockscreen.", " \r\n", " \r\nImproved messaging", " \r\n", " \r\nThe devil is in the details, they say\u2026 The iPhone is skimpy on a lot of them details. Delivery reports and a sms character counter are certainly two of those. ", " \r\n", " \r\nWith the help of the SMS Helper app you get a nicely integrated character counter, which looks as if Apple made it themselves. ", " \r\n", " \r\nNeed delivery reports? The iPhoneDelivery is a simple, but highly useful app that\u2019s capable of *delivering* you delivery reports in various customizable ways.", " \r\n", " \r\nMake ringtones out of your music without iTunes", " \r\n", " \r\nThe iPhone ringtone limitations are quite a bugger. The AnyRing app will set your incoming calls music free of Apple. ", " \r\n", " \r\nYou can choose any song from your iPod library, trim it and assign it as a ringtone or alarm tone. The downside is that you have to pay for AnyRing itself (yes, the most innovative unofficial apps are paid).", " \r\n", " \r\n6. Video recording on iPhone 2G and 3G", " \r\n", " \r\nYou don\u2019t have to own an iPhone 3GS to shoot video.

File access and management", " \r\n", " \r\nAfter you jailbreak your iPhone, you have full access to the file system. The iFile app is a popular file manager running directly on your iPhone.

Extended TV-out functionality", " \r\n", " \r\nIf you are tired of the TV-out restrictions in your iPhone, you\u2019re in for a nice surprise once you jailbreak your iPhone. The TVOut app is here to help. It enables the TV-out output for all iPhone applications.

The SBSettings app is practical as well. It gives you quick access to various features and it\u2019s always a single swipe away \u2013 some of the functionality it offers is a basic task manager, 3G, Wi-Fi and EDGE switches, respring shortcuts and even more", " \r\n"], "type": "\r\nC", "user": "karni"},

U wanna know why??? Its not because the iphone. IOS is the reason why i've sold the iphone. I need an open source!!! Since the 6.1.4 upgrade,my iphone becomes useless!!! No more jailbreak. Now im happy with my s3. Yes it does lag. But not too much. At least now i can enjoy my phone. Without rooting im also can download anything from the web,install cracked apps,share things with my friends,native video calling etc. Iphones is a  great device. But the IOS restriction will make u think twice. No doubt IOS is the simple user friendly os. It ls fast,stable, well optimized and have a ton of good quality apps. But without jailbreak, all the idevice is useless!!! Trust me. Im an ios user since the 3gs. It is better on the outside. Not in the inside. Apple does not really care about what peoples need. The only care about their business. By making all the restriction they can generate a ton of profit!!!! Itunes is sucks!!! Apple also sucks!!!! But not the iphones. Iphones is the great quality device. ", " \r\n"], "type": "\r\nU", "user": "Anonymous"},

Android users can never feel what is the meaning of net surfing, gaming, listening to music, etc till they put their hands on an iOs device. The fluid operations of the iOs just make life extremely easy. Pages is the app equivalent to MS Word on iOs or Mac, Keynote is PowerPoint of Apple and Numbers is Excel of Apple. These apps are all as useful on the mobile devices as on a Mac. I had used Android devices and purchased so many Office apps on google play.... But was relieved only after getting the Work app pack on iOs on my iPhone 5 and iPad3 with retina display. The display is extremely beautiful and it is absolutely impossible to take your eyes off ..... You just get stuck to it. Gaming experience as well. No lag, no drag, no crash.... A bit of heat is experienced when too much gaming is done. Battery life is gorgeous with wifi. Continuous chatting on 3 G gives close to 8 hours of life. Facebook chat consumes a lot of battery. Whatsapp or iMessage ( free chat iPhone to iPhone ) .. Actually iMessage is free chat on ios to ios devices... iPod touch/ iPhone / ipad... If you have the money... Just get it... Also see to it that you have a nice collection of cases as it is delicate on the edges... Extremely beautiful.. Best friend... Has replaced my laptop more than 80%... Mail checking is nice...

I was excited to install the iOS as I was looking forward to a revamped look at the new features. After 24h I want to revert. The beta is extremely stable so this has nothing to do with bugs or anything. The look is just very young, and has taken apple closer to Android / Windows but in the worse way possible. People who bought iPhones bought them to belong to a certain brand, that had a defined look and yes the Androids of this world always had better features but that was not the point. Now when I look at my iphone, I don't feel like I have an Apple product anymore. Apple was uncompromising under Jobs, \"take it or leave it\". With this new design, Apple is not innovating, they are turning in another the direction and following the pack. I never thought I would say this in 2013, but blackberry may have a play to make here in wooing serious phone users, people who want a unique UI, and people who just like to differentiate themselves from the mass.

The \u201cteardown\u201d graphic below, based on data from iSuppli, a market-research firm, shows who makes what inside the iPhone, and how much the various bits cost. Samsung turns out to be a particularly important supplier. It provides some of the phone's most important components: the flash memory that holds the phone's apps, music and operating software; the working memory, or DRAM; and the applications processor that makes the whole thing work. Together these account for 26% of the component cost of an iPhone.", " \r\n", " \r\nThis puts Samsung in the somewhat unusual position of supplying a significant proportion of one of its main rival's products, since Samsung also makes smartphones and tablet computers of its own. Apple is one of Samsung's largest customers, and Samsung is one of Apple's biggest suppliers. This is actually part of Samsung's business model: acting as a supplier of components for others gives it the scale to produce its own products more cheaply. For its part, Apple is happy to let other firms handle component production and assembly, because that leaves it free to concentrate on its strengths: designing elegant, easy-to-use combinations of hardware, software and services."], "type": "\r\nU", "user": "cheapchinaiphones"},

Been using nokia since 2000. I could choose between s4 s3 and htc one. I took a good friends advice and settled with the iphone. I honestly must say that im amazed. The camera on the phone is brilliant, it records like a video camera. Also its really easy and intuitive to use. Everything seems to be where t should. Android based phones are more juiced up lets say but the feel and usage of the iphone are unbelivable. Furthermore it doesnt lag, i can open all my apps and still get the same response ehen wrtting an email or playing a video game. I have some cons also. The baterry life is poor in my opinion, you can use the phone for just one day with wifi and 3g on. Ive been used with my e72 which could go on for a matter of several days. Besides that the iphone 5 is the best phone for me. Hope ive helped people who are in doubt on what to buy! Cheers from romania!"], "type": "\r\nU", "user": "Sergiuvl"},

Our competitors have made some significant tradeoffs in many of these areas to ship a larger display.
