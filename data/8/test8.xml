    <text>hi guys, i bought my i phone 5 just 3 months ago, one day it has given me battery error (as it looks like almost finished and after an hour it shows me full) and from last few days i am getting problem with its mouse which start and stop working automatically without any intimation, i purchased this from dg sharaf (muscat) and the time when i have contacted them they didnt give me good response as they said that i have to leave my phone with them and they will take 10 to 15 days to check and resolve this issue. as per my opinion this apple items are just costly but not durable and reliable. if anyone wants, i can show my invoice and i can provide my contact details for to give you justification on this product.</text>

    <text>best phone is one that suites your needs,,if you do not know by now then you are wasting your time buying any smartphone..these o/s have been discussed to death for years..if you do not know this by now then buy a simple phone you definetly should not buy a smartphone if you asked this question  in first place.</text>

    <text>ios is better if you don't want to change something in your iphone, but android is better if you want to make the phone as you want, everything will come easy for you.. don't forget that android last v. is better than the past. i love ios and i love android but i use android now cause its not in jail as iphone.</text>

    <text>the way you put it in that context saying android is for geeks ect is false really, as nearly all apple products are more expensive, classed as a more luuxury phone really, also the iphone battery is absolutly apauling compared to some of the galaxys, especially the s4, one of my friends has an s4 and doesnt need to charge it for what like 2 days and uses it a lot, where as my iphone 5 needs charging withing like 14 hours or less!</text>

    <text>1. more battery efficient. 2. more control over application lifecycle. 3. one quick glance in one page, you can see all notifications/date/time/badges/status of network/bt/batterylife etc. 4. no rouge application, all are tested to work and will not run in infinite loop and drain battery. 5. itunes/icloud sync. your iphone 3gs can live on with iphone 5. everything including social / games / webbrowsing / etc can be transferred over and it works. (compared to rooted android's titanium backup)  put it simply, ios is for people who want a working mobile and concentrate on real life, while android is for tweaks and geeks who have too much time on hand and spend it all on their mobile.</text>
