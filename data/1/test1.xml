    <text>using this phone presently - great hardware but ios7 can be a pain sometimes. fonts are hard to read and most apps are not yet updated to the newest version. battery life on ip5 is average by best (i'm not a heavy user). specs wise iphones have started to lag behind their competition. i'm now eyeing moto x or blackberry z30, both have great battery life.</text>

    <text>the ios7 may be amazing with its quality and added functions. but the design isn't. the picture of the apps, is like a cartoon. more of a 2-dimensional,bright bold coloured, making the device look fake like a kids toy phone. all i am saying is the look of the apps is putting me off, definitely not buying the new iphone 5s or upgrading the ios7.</text>

    <text>i have upgraded my iphone 5 to ios7. ios7 screen has become very bright. we can't see clearly in lighting. for younger guys it may be ok but for elders it has become very very hard to read texts etc. not so good as ios6. ios6 look is very elegant n very much professional. ios7 is not as good as we thought it would be. very much disappointing in some ways. keyboard is not good like in ios6. the fonts became very thin n can't be seen clearly when typing texts. the new icons don't impress much as they are flat unlike in ios6. battery drains out very fast after upgrade. contact assigned photo gets blurred when we make a call. only incoming calls photo can be seen. this is ridiculous n i am not happy about that. i want to go back to ios6, i don't like the ios7. apple must to allow customers to downgrade to ios6 from ios7. because customers paid a lot of money so they have the right to opt whatever they like on their devices but should not be forced to use whatever the apple released. customers choice must be the final but not apple's choice. in such case apple customers will gradually opt for other platforms like android or windows or whatever they think they have more options .so apple should think of it and let the customers enjoy their choice, but not the mercy of apple. change should not be only for the sake of change it should satisfy the choice of customers, and it should make not only apple fanboys but also others attract and stay with apple. so please rethink of allowing to downgrade to ios6 from ios7 in order to satisfy its customers before they start replacing their mobiles with androids. or at least change the things what they want to bring the looks of ios6 with keyboard, fonts thickness, etc etc..  this is my opinion also and i agree with comment posted above by a user. i would also like to have my old look back other wise i have to sell this one and go for samsung. just bought this in january so i feel bad. plz let me know if i can get my old look back. i will also advice my friends to check before buying.</text>
