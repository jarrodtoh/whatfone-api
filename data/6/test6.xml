    <text>i have no allegiance to any vendor but here's some stuff for you:  at work and in personal life heres some recent iphone 5 stats:  2 people at work (their personal phones) 5 swap outs between them - in the last 6 months:  1 person at work (work phone)about to have a swap out (5 days)  family members new iphone about to be swapped out (6 days).  devices are about choice and preference for some and fashion statements for others.  once thing that is clearly obvious, those that made choice can't seem to handle the fact the object of their desire isn't as great as they hoped it would be.</text>

    <text>8 cores actually do make a difference because it uses 4 a15 cores for most things and an extra 4 a6 cores to save power because when you not using the phone it switches to the low-power cores or if you just doing something simple like listening to music it can help save the battery a lot. and you obviously have no idea how ram works if you think 3gb is too much because it means the note 3 can handle things like 4k videos, do more things at once and the phone doesn't have to keep closing tasks so everything opens quicker.</text>

    <text>no matter what materials you use big phones are always easier to break than things like the little tiny iphone, because even phones a quarter of the price of iphone with the same little 3.5&quot;-4&quot; screens are almost as strong and reliable, so all apple does is give expensive materials because it makes people who don't know any better think that it makes a better phone when it's actually just for show to give people something to brag about.</text>

    <text>i'm not saying maybe businessmen are using phablets i'm telling you for a fact that it is very increasingly happening, because i'm guessing you've barely ever touched an android device because the fact is they can do 80% of what a laptop can do and businessmen who aren't stuck in an office all day are seeing the benefit of a phablet that is small enough to fit in your pocket but big enough to comfortably see the screen.</text>

    <text>yeah true. it's just the brand name that has given the luxury to offer at a premium price. nothing more than that.</text>

    <text>it's not better but there was an expectation.  this means, that people thought they wuold get better o/s, redesidned look and feel to the phone.  there was nothing really new introduced to the phone which is why the market does not think it's better, and that is why you see the lower rating.  personally i use iphone and galaxy phones but on my personal phone i switched to galaxy when the s2 came out.  there was no comparing, iphone is miles behind.</text>

    <text>iphone has less features than android but enough. but some features of todays phones are required.it run better and faster than android in less ram and smaller processor. the problem is stupid restrictions like that prison itunes. irritates too much. and that theme on ios 7 is very ugly. i think 5s wont be good and not much new but make 6 innovative and give freedom. please dont follow &quot;make everything large&quot; like sheep. not large than 4.3&quot;. make iphablets for those who are asking for large screen</text>

    <text>taking over? haha. c'mon business men have laptops. you can see a few with tablets but. mostly kids have tablets for gaming. smoothness reliability durability and accuracy are just one of the few reasons why people still choose iphone. can't argue with that.</text>
