    <text>apple please remove your restrictions and youll reach very high. you dont even need more features(though add some new features in next ios please.) your perormance and stability is enough reason for people to buy ios devices. i used. 4s and s3(both not latest but good enough) and 4s performs better even s3 has more features. do it soon before android becomes stable please</text>

    <text>something i would also like to share. google play doesn't support much of the apps you use like whatsapp, viber, subway surfers (game) in countries in south america whereas apple itunessupports any app no matter where you are. although you have to pay for some apps but using it on ios is better than downloading it on android. so people the best is to go for iphone cause any apple product has the best performance over all. so stop hesitating between s3 and s4 and go for iphone 5 :)</text>

    <text>10 good reasons to jailbreak your iphone, no matter what generation . . . i guess theres a large number of iphone owners that are still hesitant to jailbreak their iphones. they consider jailbreaking a dangerous and daunting task that may eventually void their warranty. since im on the other side of that barricade, ive put down a nice list of the 10 new features you will get if you go for jailbreaking. the benefits are more than ten, but ive compiled the most major ones.  jailbreaking is a software process that unlocks the access to the iphone original system files so that you can modify some of them for the better. you shouldnt confuse it with a carrier unlock. jailbreaking allows us to unleash the true power of the apples iphone.  getting your iphone jailbroken is like getting a totally different device  at least software-wise. and while i find it next to impossible to resist the tempting new features, i can totally understand you may have perfectly good reasons to keep your iphone untouched. but hopefully, this list will help you convert.  and a word of warning! this post is not a tutorial in jailbreaking your iphone. if you need one, a nice place to start is iclarified iphone section. installing unofficial third-party apps may cause unwanted side effects so always rely on your good judgment when dealing with those. i am not to be held responsible for any damage you may inflict to your iphone.  1. multitasking  the first new benefit from jailbreaking is surely true multitasking. there is a free and a paid app that both offer task switching and management each in its own way. both depend on a third-party app  the free backgrounder  to do the minimizing for them. while that may sound complex, switching apps is as easy as it gets.  the free task manager is called kirikae and shows the running apps as a list. tapping one will switch to it, while a finger swipe reveals a button to kill the process.  multifl0w is the paid task manager. it offers the same functionality as kirikae, but uses a cover-flow-like view for your running apps. its kinda like the way safari displays the opened tabs. multifl0w looks really fancy and even outperforms palm pres card interface at times.  lockscreen applications  thanks to the several available lockscreen applications like lockinfo and intelliscreen, you can get acess to your calls, messages, calendar events, weather information, etc. straight from the iphone lockscreen.  improved messaging  the devil is in the details, they say the iphone is skimpy on a lot of them details. delivery reports and a sms character counter are certainly two of those.  with the help of the sms helper app you get a nicely integrated character counter, which looks as if apple made it themselves.  need delivery reports? the iphonedelivery is a simple, but highly useful app thats capable of *delivering* you delivery reports in various customizable ways.  make ringtones out of your music without itunes  the iphone ringtone limitations are quite a bugger. the anyring app will set your incoming calls music free of apple.  you can choose any song from your ipod library, trim it and assign it as a ringtone or alarm tone. the downside is that you have to pay for anyring itself (yes, the most innovative unofficial apps are paid).  6. video recording on iphone 2g and 3g  you dont have to own an iphone 3gs to shoot video. thanks to the cycorder app you can capture videos at cif resolution at 15fps, which is way better than that joke of a video recorder in the official appstore.  7. file access and management  after you jailbreak your iphone, you have full access to the file system. the ifile app is a popular file manager running directly on your iphone. it is capable of copying, cutting, moving, renaming and deleting files.  8. safari file download manager  if youve missed having a way to download files on the iphone, you may be interested in the safari download plug-in. its basically a download manager for the mobile safari browser. however you will need a file manager to access the files once theyre downloaded.  9. extended tv-out functionality  if you are tired of the tv-out restrictions in your iphone, youre in for a nice surprise once you jailbreak your iphone. the tvout app is here to help. it enables the tv-out output for all iphone applications. it has some problems with the landscape apps, but theres another application called landscape tv out that fixes that as well. now imagine playing your iphone games on a big tv screen.  10. misc ui improvements  as i mentioned in the beginning of the article, there are a lot of other benefits from jailbreaking. though none of them is a major thing, i appreciate every single one.  if you happen to own an iphone 2g or 3g you will most definitely welcome the battery percentage level (3gs-style) that can be enabled via the asbattery app.  perhaps all iphone users will appreciate the hapticpro app, which enables vibration touch feedback. the sbsettings app is practical as well. it gives you quick access to various features and its always a single swipe away  some of the functionality it offers is a basic task manager, 3g, wi-fi and edge switches, respring shortcuts and even more</text>
